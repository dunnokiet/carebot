You can also exclude the “salt to taste.”You can also use half of the amount of broth the recipe calls for and replace the other half with water.Moreover, it is important to rinse the canned kidney beans with water before using them.

    "articleTextBody": "Kegel exercises strengthen your pelvic floor muscles and can support your bladder and bowel function.Kegel exercises are simple clench-and-release exercises that you can do to make the muscles of your pelvic floor stronger. Your pelvis is the area between your hips that holds your reproductive organs. The pelvic floor is really a series of muscles and tissues that forms a sling, or hammock, at the bottom of your pelvis. This sling holds your organs in place. A weak pelvic floor may lead to issues such as the inability to control your bowels or bladder.Once you understand Kegel exercises, you can do them anytime and anywhere — in the privacy of your own home or while waiting in line at the bank. Why do Kegel exercises?Both women and men can benefit from Kegel exercises.Many factors can weaken the pelvic floor in women, such as pregnancy, childbirth, aging, and weight gain. The pelvic floor muscles support the womb, the bladder, and the bowels. If the muscles are weak, these pelvic organs may lower into a woman’s vagina. Besides being extremely uncomfortable, this can also cause urinary incontinence.Men may also experience weakening in the muscles of their pelvic floor as they age. This can lead to incontinence of both urine and feces, especially if the man has had prostate surgery. Finding the pelvic floor muscles in womenWhen you’re first starting Kegel exercises, finding the right set of muscles can be tricky. One way to find them is by placing a clean finger inside your vagina and tightening your vaginal muscles around your finger.You can also locate the muscles by trying to stop your urine mid-flow. The muscles you use for this action are your pelvic floor muscles. Get used to how they feel when they contract and relax.However, you should use this method for learning purposes only. It isn’t a good idea to start and stop your urine regularly, or to frequently do Kegel exercises when you have a full bladder. Incomplete emptying of the bladder can raise your risk for a urinary tract infection (UTI).Talk with your gynecologist if you still aren’t sure you’ve found the right muscles. They may recommend using an object called a vaginal cone. You insert a vaginal cone into the vagina and then use your pelvic floor muscles to keep it in place.Biofeedback training can also be very useful in helping to identify and isolate your pelvic floor muscles. In this procedure, a doctor will insert a small probe into your vagina or put adhesive electrodes on the outside of your vagina or anus. You’ll be asked to try to do a Kegel. A monitor will show whether you contracted the correct muscles and how long you were able to hold the contraction. Finding the pelvic floor muscles in menMen often have the same kind of trouble when it comes to identifying the correct group of pelvic floor muscles. For men, one way to find them is to insert a finger into the rectum and try to squeeze it — without tightening the muscles of the abdomen, buttocks, or thighs.Another helpful trick is to tense the muscles that keep you from passing gas.If you’re still having trouble, practice stopping the flow of urine. As with women, this is a reliable way to locate the pelvic floor muscles, but it shouldn’t become a regular practice.Biofeedback can also help men locate the pelvic floor muscles. If you’re having trouble locating them on your own, you may want to make an appointment with your doctor. Goals and benefits of Kegel exercisesAlways empty your bladder before doing Kegel exercises. As a beginner, you should find a quiet, private place to sit or to lie down before doing your exercises. As you practice, you’ll find you can do them anywhere.When you first start doing Kegel exercises, tense the muscles in your pelvic floor for a count of three, then relax them for a count of three. Keep going until you’ve done 10 repetitions. Over the next several days, practice until you can hold your muscles tense for a count of 10. Your goal should be to do three sets of 10 repetitions every day.Don’t be discouraged if you don’t see the results you want immediately. According to the Mayo Clinic, Kegel exercises may take as long as a few months to have an effect on urinary incontinence. They also work differently for each person. Some people show great improvement in muscle control and urinary continence. However, Kegels may prevent your condition from getting worse. CautionsIf you feel pain in your abdomen or back after a Kegel exercise session, it’s a sign that you’re not doing them correctly. Always remember that — even as you contract your pelvic floor muscles — the muscles in your abdomen, back, buttocks, and sides should remain loose.Finally, don’t overdo your Kegel exercises. If you work the muscles too hard, they’ll become tired and unable to fulfill their necessary functions.",

    "articleTextBody": "Heel spurs are formed by deposits of calcium on the bottom of the heel bone. These deposits cause a bony growth that begins at the front of your heel bone and extends toward the arch or toes.It’s possible for heel spurs to cause pain and discomfort, but many people have heel spurs without having any symptoms.According to Cleveland Clinic, heel spurs only cause pain in people half of the time. Sometimes you’ll have a heel spur and not feel any pain, and sometimes heel pain can have other causes.Plantar fasciitis linkMany people who have heel spurs also have plantar fasciitis, which can contribute to the pain. This condition occurs when the connective tissue, known as the plantar fascia, becomes inflamed and painful. The plantar fascia runs from your heel to your toes and supports the arch of your foot.While heel spurs may require surgery in some cases, you can do stretches to help to ease the pain and discomfort. These stretches can also relieve pain and inflammation caused by plantar fasciitis. In addition, they help to reduce tightness in the calves, which can contribute to heel pain by causing tension in the plantar fascia. ExercisesHere are eight simple exercises that you can do to help ease your symptoms. They can be done all at once or a few times throughout the day. 1. Foot flex This simple stretch is especially beneficial to do right when you wake up when you’re sitting up in bed. It stretches the plantar fascia that tightens while you sleep.Use your hand to pull your toes back toward your shin. Hold this position for about 30 seconds. Do each side two to three times. 2. Calf stretch on a step This exercise provides a deep stretch to the calves. This alleviates tension in your feet and improves mobility. Stand on the ball of your right foot at the edge of a step, with your heel hanging off the step. Slowly, lower your heel down as far as you can. Hold this position for 15 to 30 seconds. Repeat on the left foot. Do each side two to four times. 3. Toe towel grab This stretch strengthens and stretches the arches of your feet and improves flexibility. Place a small towel under your foot. Curl your toes to grip the towel. Raise the front of your foot off the floor. Hold this position for a few seconds.Release the towel as you lift up your toes and spread them as far apart as possible. 4. Wall calf stretch This stretch deeply stretches your calves and heels. This helps to relieve tightness and pain in your legs and feet, which increases mobility. Stand a few feet from a wall with your left foot in front of your right foot.Lean toward the wall as you bend your left knee slightly.Slowly place your weight into your left foot.Keep your right knee straight as you lift your right heel off the ground. Feel the stretch along your back calf.Hold this position for 15 to 30 seconds.Do each side two to five times.5. Wall squat calf stretch This exercise targets your calf muscles and helps to increase flexibility and build strength. Come into a squatting position with your back firmly against a wall. Your hips should be in line with your knees, with your ankles directly underneath.Slowly lift both heels off the floor.Hold this position for a few seconds, then return your feet to the starting position.Do 2 to 3 sets of 8 to 12 repetitions.For the next three exercises, you can follow along with this helpful video we found or use the directions below:6. Calf stretch with band For this stretch, you’ll need a yoga strap or exercise band. You can also use a towel that’s folded lengthwise to make a strap. This exercise stretches your calves, which helps to prevent the muscle from pulling the plantar fascia. Sit in a chair or lie down on your back.Place the strap under the arch of your right foot, using both hands to hold the ends. Use the strap to pull the top of your foot toward you, flexing your foot toward your shin.Hold this position for 15 to 30 seconds. Do each side three to five times. 7. Golf ball roll This stretch loosens up the fascia along the bottom of your feet, helping to relieve pain in your heel. Roll a golf ball under your right foot. Continue for up to 1 minute. Do each foot two to three times. 8. Walking the dog This exercise provides a deep stretch to your calf and Achilles tendon. It loosens up your legs and releases tension in your legs and spine. Come into Downward-Facing Dog with your heels lifted.One at a time, press your heel into the floor, bending the opposite knee. Alternate between sides every few seconds, then hold each side for about 30 seconds. Other treatments There are several conservative treatments and home remedies that you can do to manage your symptoms such as pain and inflammation. Over-the-counter pain medications, such as ibuprofen or aspirin, can be taken to alleviate symptoms. Supplements for reducing inflammation are also available. Here are some ways to treat heel spurs:Ice. Use an ice pack or cold compress on your foot for 10 to 15 minutes at a time. This is especially beneficial at the end of a long day or when you’ve spent a lot of time on your feet. Or, roll a frozen water bottle under your foot. This method incorporates a bit of massage, relieving tightness in the bottom of your foot.Massage. Massaging the arch of your foot helps to relieve pain and promote mobility. Use your fingers and knuckles to deeply massage your foot for 1 to 5 minutes at a time. One technique is to place both thumbs at the center line of your arch and move them to the outer edges of your feet.Inserts. Use cushion inserts in your shoes for additional support and cushioning. Inexpensive options can be purchased off the shelf. Wear supportive shoes with thicker soles and extra cushioning for additional support that can help to reduce tension in the plantar fascia. Kinesiology tape can be used to improve arch and heel support.Night splints. Many people find quick and effective results by using night splints. They can be worn while sleeping to stretch the plantar fascia. They help to keep the plantar fascia relaxed and prevent you from pointing your feet down.Injections. Cortisone injections into the plantar fascia may be used to reduce pain and inflammation.Extracorporeal shockwave therapy (ESWT). This is a noninvasive treatment that uses high-energy shockwave impulses to repair plantar fascia tissue. While results aren’t consistent, it’s sometimes used to see if surgery can be prevented.Cryoultrasound therapy. Cryoultrasound therapy may help to treat pain in people who have both plantar fasciitis and heel spurs. This technique uses electromagnetic energy and cold therapy to relieve pain.Surgery. Surgery is recommended as a last resort and only after a full year of conservative treatment.When to see a doctor See your doctor if you have severe pain or pain that doesn’t improve after a few weeks of treatment. It’s possible that heel pain could be caused by a condition such as arthritis or tendonitis. Or it could be some type of stress fracture. You may be prescribed physical therapy, chiropractic care, or massage therapy. Even if your symptoms are mild, you may want to see your doctor to assess your condition and make sure you’re on the road to recovery. This is especially important if you take any medications or have any other health conditions that may be affected by these stretches or treatments.The bottom lineConsistently doing stretches and exercises can help to reduce pain and inflammation from heel spurs and plantar fasciitis. It’s a good idea to continue doing the stretches even once your feet feel better in order to prevent a recurrence. If your symptoms don’t improve over time or become intensified, you should seek medical treatment. See your doctor if your pain persists, worsens, or becomes severe.",

    "articleTextBody": "No gym? No problem. Bodyweight exercises are an excellent way to train your back muscles when your access to weights is limited or you’re looking for a way to change up your workouts. Using your body weight as resistance means you can squeeze in a workout when time is tight. It also gives you a chance to focus on your form before adding weight via dumbbells, kettlebells, or machines. Plus, bodyweight back exercises are convenient, affordable, and easy to modify for different fitness levels. The 12 exercises detailed below target the upper, middle, and lower back muscles. Getty ImagesMuscle groups worked during bodyweight back exercises Performing exercises that target the large and small back muscles can improve your posture and ease low back pain. It can also boost sports performance and help you perform daily tasks (1). Your back muscles are separated into two categories: extrinsic and intrinsic. The extrinsic muscles, which include the lats and traps, are likely more familiar to you and easier to identify than the intrinsic muscles, such as the interspinales and erector spinae (2). And while memorizing anatomical names isn’t a prerequisite, it’s a nice way to familiarize yourself with the muscles you’re working when performing these exercises. Extrinsic back musclesThe extrinsic back muscles help move the upper limbs, scapula, and humerus. They also aid in rib movement and respiration. trapeziuslatissimus dorsilevator scapulaerhomboids (major and minor)serratus posterior (superior and inferior)Intrinsic back musclesThe intrinsic back muscles act together to help maintain your posture and move the vertebral column. splenius muscleserector spinae (also known as the paraspinal muscles)transversospinal muscles (semispinalis, multifidus, and rotatores)interspinales and intertransversarii musclesHow to perform bodyweight back exercisesTo create a bodyweight back workout, you can choose two to three exercises from this list and add them to a full-body routine, or select five to six exercises to perform as a standalone back workout. If you’re performing the moves as part of a back workout, do the recommended sets and reps and rest for 1 minute between exercises. Although you’ll be using your body weight for resistance, you do need a few props to perform some of the moves. More specifically, two exercises require an exercise band, two use a bar, and one uses a TRX suspension trainer or similar system. Feel free to skip these exercises if you don’t have access to equipment — there are plenty of other moves that work the same muscle groups. Before jumping into any workout, spend at least 5 minutes warming up. This should include light cardio to raise your heart rate and dynamic movements like arm circles.Bodyweight back exercises you can do at homeSupermanThis exercise targets the upper and lower back muscles, including the rhomboids, trapezius, and erector spinae. It also works your core, glutes, and shoulders.Directions:Lie facedown on the floor with your arms stretched out in front of you and your legs extended.Pull the abdominals away from the floor toward your spine. Aim to maintain this abdominal connection as you move through the exercise. Engage the back muscles and glutes to lift your arms and legs off the floor simultaneously. Hold this position for 5 seconds, then return to the starting position. Complete 3 sets of 12 reps. Variations: To make this easier on your neck, you can widen your arms out in front to form a “Y,” or out to the sides to form a “T.”Reverse snow angelThis exercise targets the upper and mid-back muscles, including the latissimus dorsi, rhomboids, and levator scapulae. It also works the glutes, core, and shoulders.Directions:Lie facedown on an exercise mat with your legs extended, feet together, and arms by your sides — palms facing down. Slightly lift your arms off the ground and bring them out to the side. Move through a wide arc overhead and back until your arms are at your sides, your hands are next to your legs, and your fingertips are pointing toward your feet. Repeat this motion. Complete 3 sets of 12 reps. Prone pullThe prone pull works the upper and mid-back muscles, including the latissimus dorsi, rhomboids, levator scapulae, and trapezius. It also works the shoulders and arms.Directions:Lie facedown on an exercise mat with your legs extended and feet together.Stretch your arms to the front — palms facing the floor but not touching. Pull your elbows down toward your lower back and squeeze your shoulder blades together.Return to the starting position and repeat.Complete 3 sets of 12 reps. Plank rowThis exercise strengthens the upper, middle, and lower back muscles, including the latissimus dorsi, rhomboids, trapezius, and erector spinae. It also works the core, glutes, and arms. Directions:Begin in a plank position with your hands flat on the floor and arms extended. Engage your core and lift your right arm to perform a rowing motion. Pause at the top and return your right hand to the floor. Repeat on the left side and alternate arms. Do 2 sets, alternating arms for 30 seconds each time. Banded rowThe banded row targets the upper and mid-back muscles, including the latissimus dorsi, rhomboids, and trapezius. It also works the arms and core. Directions: Loop a resistance band around a secure structure like a pole. Stand tall facing the structure and hold one end of the band in each hand. Step back until you feel enough resistance. Pull the band toward your torso in a rowing motion. Keep your elbows near your body. Pause and return to the starting position.Complete 3 sets of 12 reps. Seated pulldownThis band exercise targets the upper and mid-back muscles, including latissimus dorsi, rhomboids, and trapezius. It also works the shoulders and arms. Directions: Loop an exercise band around a bar or fixed point like a door frame. You should be able to grab the ends of the band when seated or kneeling. Sit or kneel on a mat with your body upright, your core engaged, and a neutral spine. Kneel on one knee if kneeling on both is too difficult. Grab each end of the exercise band and pull it straight down until your thumbs are next to your shoulders. Make sure to squeeze your shoulder blades back and downward. Pause, then return to the starting position. Do 3 sets of 12 reps.Wide grip pullupThe wide grip pullup targets the upper, middle, and lower back muscles, including the latissimus dorsi, trapezius, erector spinae, and rhomboids. It also works the shoulders, arms, and core. Directions:Stand underneath a pullup bar and reach up and grab it with each hand. Your grip should be wider than your body. Looking straight ahead, pull your body up toward the bar using your back muscles. Pause, then slowly lower yourself to the original position. Complete 5–15 reps or as many as you can perform. Do 2 sets.Inverted rowThe inverted row exercise will strengthen the upper and mid-back muscles, including the latissimus dorsi, rhomboids, and trapezius. It also works the arms and core. You can use a Smith Machine, barbell in a squat rack, or fixed bar or railing.Directions: Set the bar to a height that allows your arms to fully extend when lying down.Lie down on your back under the bar. Grab it with a wide overhand grip. Engage the core muscles and glutes and pull your body to the bar. The bar will barely touch your chest at the top of the movement. Keep your heels in contact with the floor and ensure your body is in a straight line. Lower to the starting position and repeat. Do 3 sets of 10 reps. To make this exercise more challenging, place your heels on an elevated surface.Suspended rowThe suspended row targets the upper and mid-back muscles, including the latissimus dorsi, rhomboids, and trapezius. It also works the shoulders, biceps, and core. Directions:Stand facing a TRX suspension or similar system and grab both handles in an overhand grip.

Contract your upper back, biceps, and core muscles to pull yourself up. Pause, then straighten your arms and lean back to repeat. Do 3 sets of 12 reps.When using suspension trainers, keeping your body at more of a vertical angle will make the exercise easier. Completing the exercise at a more horizontal angle will be harder — the closer you are to horizontal, the more challenging it will be.Bird dogBird dog is a popular exercise that works the upper, middle, and lower back muscles, including the erector spinae, latissimus dorsi, and trapezius. It also trains the glutes, core, and shoulders.Directions:Start on all fours with your knees under your hips and your hands beneath your shoulders.

    "articleTextBody": "Breathing exercises have been used to promote health in Eastern cultures for thousands of years (1).In recent years, several studies have found that breathing exercises may help reduce stress levels and improve attention and emotional well-being (2, 3).What’s more, some proponents of this popular practice even claim that adding breathing exercises to your routine may aid weight loss and boost fat burning.This article takes a look at some of the science behind breathing exercises to determine whether they work for weight loss.Mosuno/Stocksy UnitedWhat are breathing exercises?Breathing exercises are a simple practice that involves minimizing external distractions and paying closer attention to your breathing.Studies show that breathing exercises may be associated with several potential health benefits, including decreased anxiety and improved attention levels and sleep quality (2, 4, 5).There are numerous types of breathing exercises, including:Deep breathing. This form of breathing exercise involves taking a deep breath, holding it for a few seconds, and then releasing it slowly.Alternate nostril breathing. With this exercise, you practice inhaling and exhaling through alternating nostrils by using your fingers to close one side at a time.Pursed lip breathing. This type of breathing practice involves inhaling through your nostrils and exhaling slowly through pursed lips.Diaphragmatic breathing. Also known as belly breathing, this variation requires you to lie down, place your hands on your upper chest and rib cage, and exhale through pursed lips as you tighten your stomach muscles.Senobi. This Japanese style of deep breathing involves leaning back, stretching your arms overhead, and inhaling and exhaling slowly several times.Although each style has slight variations in terms of how it’s practiced, all forms are used to help promote relaxation and relieve stress by bringing your focus to the present moment.summaryThere are several styles and variations of breathing exercises, each of which involves paying close attention to your breathing to reduce stress and promote relaxation.May be linked to weight lossSeveral studies have found that practicing breathing exercises may promote weight loss and decrease body fat.One study in 40 women noted that practicing Senobi increased both the excretion of hormones through the urine and sympathetic nerve activity, which is responsible for your body’s “fight or flight” response (6).What’s more, participants with obesity who repeated the exercise regularly for 1 month experienced a significant reduction in body fat (6).In another small study in 38 people, those who participated in a diaphragmatic breathing exercise experienced a higher resting metabolic rate, which may lead to increased weight loss (7).Additionally, an 2-week study showed that practicing breathing exercises for 45 minutes daily 6 days per week significantly reduced body weight and body mass index (BMI), compared with a control group (8).summarySome studies show that regularly practicing breathing exercises may support weight loss and fat loss.May decrease hunger and appetiteSome research has found that practicing breathing exercises may reduce feelings of hunger, which may help decrease food intake and promote weight loss.A study in 60 people showed that performing a breathing exercise, which involved holding their breath for 3–4 seconds while contracting their stomach muscles, decreased feelings of hunger on an empty stomach (9).Similarly, a small study observed that practicing slow-paced breathing for 10 minutes significantly reduced hunger in 65 women (10).Another study in 68 people evaluated the effects of practicing supervised yoga for 45 minutes twice daily for 15 days, which included 33 minutes of breathing exercises per session (11).Participants not only experienced a significant reduction in BMI and belly fat but also increased levels of leptin, which is the hormone responsible for stimulating feelings of fullness (11, 12).summaryStudies show that breathing exercises may decrease feelings of hunger and increase leptin, the hormone that regulates feelings of fullness.Can reduce stress levelsBreathing exercises can be an effective way to reduce stress levels.In fact, multiple studies show that breathing exercises can help alleviate feelings of stress, anxiety, and depression (13, 14, 15).Increased levels of cortisol, the stress hormone, may be tied to a higher risk of weight gain and obesity (16, 17, 18).What’s more, higher levels of cortisol may be associated with increased food cravings and contribute to emotional eating (19, 20).While more research is needed, this suggests that practicing stress-reducing activities, such as breathing exercises, may help prevent overeating and promote weight loss.summaryBreathing exercises can decrease stress levels, which otherwise may contribute to weight gain, food cravings, and emotional eating.How to get startedAdding breathing exercises to your daily routine doesn’t have to be tedious or time-consuming.Start by setting aside a few minutes each day to practice, ideally three to four times per day.You can pick whatever style or variation works for you, whether it’s alternate nostril breathing, diaphragmatic breathing, or simply deep breathing.Be sure to sit or stand in a comfortable position and minimize any external distractions so that you can fully focus.Practice your choice of breathing exercise for a few minutes and slowly increase the duration of your sessions as you start to feel more comfortable.Once you find what works for you, you can also incorporate poses, mantras, or other mindfulness exercises into your practice, such as yoga or meditation.summaryTo get started with breathing exercises, pick a type that works for you and set aside time to practice each day. You can also increase your duration slowly and incorporate poses, mantras, or mindfulness activities into your practice.The bottom lineBreathing exercises are a common practice that involves paying closer attention to your breath to promote relaxation.Promising research shows that regularly practicing breathing exercises may be linked to increased weight loss and reduced body fat.Plus, some studies have found that breathing exercises may reduce hunger and appetite and decrease stress levels, which may also help support weight loss.For best results, be sure to combine breathing exercises with a well-rounded diet and other healthy habits, including regular physical activity and practices like yoga or meditation.",

    "articleTextBody": "Whether you’re looking to maximize muscle gains or improve your body composition and health, resistance exercise is essential to meeting your goals. While compound exercises work multiple muscle groups at a time, isolation exercises seek to stimulate only one muscle group in an effort to provide muscle growth.Though it’s best to include a combination of compound and isolation exercises in your fitness routine, this comprehensive list covers 103 isolation exercises for your whole body, including how to perform them.If you’re unsure whether an exercise fits your experience level or concerned about an underlying injury or health condition, it’s best to discuss your training plan with a qualified trainer.Felix Hug/Stocksy UnitedLegs: quadsThe quadriceps, often referred to as quads, are the muscle group that comprises the front portion of your thigh.These muscles mainly serve to allow extension (straightening) of the knee joint.This group is made up of four muscles — the vastus lateralis, vastus intermedius, vastus medialis, and rectus femoris.These muscles are best stimulated by leg-pushing movements.1. High bar squatsWhile squats are technically a compound movement, placing the bar a bit higher on your back and narrowing your stance a little can serve to efficiently isolate the quads.How to perform2. Leg press The leg press serves as a great alternative to squats — not only for those just beginning their training journey but also advanced trainees.Just like with squats, keeping your stance a bit narrower will help activate your quads.How to perform3. Front squatWith the front squat, the bar is placed just above the clavicle, which moves the center of gravity forward and makes the quads the prime mover for this exercise.How to perform (alternate grip)4. Bulgarian split squatWhile the split squat targets multiple muscle groups, it does a great job of hitting the quads.The movement is performed by putting one foot up on a flat bench behind you and squatting down with the forward leg. You can hold a dumbbell in each hand for added difficulty. It can also be performed with a loaded barbell or Smith machine as you become more advanced.How to perform5. Hack squatThe hack squat is essentially the opposite of the leg press.Instead of pushing against a weighted platform, you’re pushing against weighted pads that lie on your shoulders.Just as with the leg press and squat, keeping your stance narrow will help better isolate the quads.How to perform6. Leg extensionThe leg extension is the gold standard for quad isolation exercises, as there’s minimal involvement of any other muscle groups.Most machines utilize a weighted pad that’s placed against your lower shin and pushed against to activate the quads.How to perform7. Goblet squatThe goblet squat is another squat variation in which a kettlebell or dumbbell is held out in front of the body as you squat down.To better stimulate the quads, you can place a 2.5-pound (1-kg) or 5-pound (2.5-kg) plate under your heel and keep your stance a bit narrower.How to performLegs: hamstringsThe hamstrings are another major muscle group located on the backside of your legs.These muscles serve to flex the leg at the knee joint and also assist in extending the hips.They’re made up of three main muscles — the semitendinosus, semimembranosus, and biceps femoris.These muscles are best stimulated by pulling and hip hinging movements. 8. Leg curl The leg curl tends to be the gold standard when it comes to hamstring isolation exercises. While there are several variations, this movement uses a weighted pad that is placed just below the calf muscles and curled in toward your legs.How to perform (seated or lying)9. Romanian deadliftWhile the Romanian deadlift stimulates some other muscle groups, the primary movers are the hamstrings. For this movement, a weighted barbell or dumbbells are held in your hands as you bend at the hips with a slight bend at the knees, providing an excellent stretch for the hamstrings.How to perform (dumbbell version)10. Glute ham raiseThe glute ham raise is a unique piece of equipment that’s becoming more popular in training facilities throughout the world. When performed properly, it can efficiently isolate the hamstrings and glutes to provide maximum muscle activation and growth.How to perform11. Single-leg deadliftThe single-leg deadlift most commonly uses either a kettlebell or dumbbell held in the opposite hand of the hamstring you’re targeting.The weight is then lowered toward the floor while bending at the hips, allowing your non-working leg to track straight back and serving as a great stretch for the working hamstring. The exercise is performed on each side until the desired numbers of reps and sets are reached.How to perform12. Resistance band leg curlThe band leg curl is a great alternative when you don’t have access to a leg curl machine.For this movement, the band is secured to an anchor point.Next, lie on your stomach while wrapping the band just below your calf muscle. Curl it up toward your hamstring and slowly return to the starting position.How to performLegs: glutesThe glutes, which are scientifically referred to as the gluteus maximus and gluteus medius, make up a large part of your posterior leg musculature.These large and powerful muscles are responsible for the extension and lateral rotation of the hip joint. They’re best isolated with hip hinging and thrusting movements.13. Barbell hip thrustThe barbell hip thrust is one of the best exercises for stimulating the glutes.A loaded barbell, usually with padding, is positioned over the hips with your back braced against a low flat bench. A hip thrusting motion is then performed for the desired number of reps and sets.How to perform14. Dumbbell or barbell walking lungeWhile the walking lunge stimulates multiple muscle groups, it can be an excellent exercise for working the glutes. Place either a loaded barbell on your back or dumbbells in your hands and perform a repetitive lunging motion while you pay close attention to muscle contraction of the glutes. How to perform the dumbbell version (barbell version)15. Cable pull-throughThe cable pull-through is a unique alternative to the hip thrust when equipment isn’t available or you feel like switching things up. A rope attachment is fixed to a low cable. With your back facing the weight stack, grasp the rope in your hands between your legs. Resting your hands on your thighs, thrust the weight while paying close attention to the contraction of the glutes. How to perform16. Machine glute kickbackThe glute kickback is a readily available piece of equipment in most gyms and can be a fantastic choice for working the glutes.How to perform17. Glute bridgeWhile the glute bridge requires some flexibility, no equipment is needed, so it can be performed at home.The movement is started by lying down with your feet flat and perpendicular to the floor.A thrusting motion is then performed to contract the glutes for the desired amount of reps.How to performLegs: calvesThe calves are an important muscle group located on the back of your lower leg.They comprise two major muscles called the gastrocnemius and soleus. They’re mainly responsible for plantar flexion, which refers to the extension of the foot down away from the body, such as when jumping or running. 18. Seated calf raiseThe seated calf raise is one of the more common movements utilized to work the calves. Due to the angle at the knee while the movement is performed, it predominantly targets the soleus muscle.How to perform (without machine)19. Standing calf raiseThe standing calf raise serves as a good complement to the seated calf raise.Given that this movement hits the calves with the legs relatively straight, it mainly targets the gastrocnemius muscle. How to perform (without machine)20. Stair calf raiseThe stair calf raise is a unique movement that can be performed anywhere you have access to stairs. The movement is performed similarly to a standing calf raise, extending your feet at the ankle joint and allowing your ankle to go below the surface of the step to get a good contraction.How to perform (single leg)21. Smith machine calf raiseThe Smith machine calf raise is similar to a standing calf raise, although the resistance is provided by a loaded Smith machine bar on your back.It’s helpful to perform the movement with your toes on a step platform, which allows your heels to track down to get a full range of motion with each rep.How to performBackCavan Images/Offset ImagesThe back comprises numerous muscles, both big and small, though the major muscles include the lats (latissimus dorsi), traps (trapezius), and erector spinae (lower back).These muscles are responsible for the movement of your spine, stabilizing the trunk, and coordinating the movement of your limbs. What’s unique about the back is that it’s best trained from different angles to maximize muscle gains. Back: vertical movements22. Pullup or assisted pullupThe pullup is a classic back exercise. When it’s performed correctly, it can recruit most of the back muscles.While there are different variations, the standard pullup starts by hanging from a bar with a medium width grip and pulling your body up with your back muscles until your chin is just above the bar.How to perform (assisted)23. Lat pulldownThe lat pulldown is another bread-and-butter back movement.This movement mimics the motion of a pullup and is an excellent alternative, as the weight can be adjusted to match your level of strength and experience.How to perform24. Straight arm pulldownThe straight arm pulldown is a fantastic back isolation movement that provides a nice stretch at the top.This movement is performed similarly to a tricep pushdown, but the arms are kept straight, focusing on contracting the lats.How to perform25. Hammer strength high rowThis is a unique machine exercise that’s widely available in gyms. The movement is similar to that of a lat pulldown, but the individual handles allow for increased variation and even make it possible to perform the movement with one arm at a time. How to performBack: horizontal movements26. Bent over rowThe bent over row is another classic back exercise that’s excellent for adding back thickness.The exercise is performed by starting with a loaded barbell or dumbbells in your hands, bending slightly at the hips and knees, and rowing the weight up toward your belly button.How to perform with a barbell (dumbbell)27. Inverted rowThe inverted row is an excellent horizontal pulling exercise for hitting the mid-back.It’s best performed on a Smith machine set in a lower position, although if the movement is too difficult, you can raise the bar a bit to make it easier.How to perform28. Seated cable rowThe seated cable row is a classic horizontal back movement for building thickness and size.Make sure you keep an upright posture and get a full stretch at the end of each rep for maximal muscle stimulation. How to perform29. Incline dumbbell rowThe incline dumbbell row is another alternative to the chest supported row machine.An incline bench is set at a 30–45-degree angle. You then sit on the bench backward with your chest facing the pad. Finally, you grasp a pair of dumbbells and row them up just until your upper arm is perpendicular to the pad. How to performLower back30. Good morningThe good morning is a classic strength and conditioning exercise for building lower back strength, though it also hits the hamstrings and glutes to a good degree.It’s important to perform this movement with good form to reduce the risk of injury.How to perform31. Back extensionThe back extension is a widely available piece of equipment that’s great for targeting the lower back.As you become more advanced, you can hold a weight plate or dumbbell in your hand to make the exercise a bit more difficult.How to perform32. SupermanThe superman requires no equipment and can be performed in the comfort of your own home. It’s an excellent exercise for targeting the posterior muscles, including the lower back.If you find it too difficult to raise both arms and legs at the same time, try alternating by first raising your left arm and right leg and then your right arm and left leg.How to perform (alternating Superman)33. Bird dogsBird dogs are another tried-and-true exercise for strengthening the core.Also requiring no equipment, they’re a great addition to a home workout program.How to performBack: traps34. Dumbbell shrugThe dumbbell shrug is similar to the barbell shrug but allows for increased variation during the movement by utilizing a dumbbell in each hand.How to perform35. Machine shrugThe machine shrug is a plate–loaded option that allows for efficient isolation of the traps.How to perform36. Seated dumbbell shrugSeated dumbbell shrugs are an excellent way to eliminate the other muscles of the trunk and fully isolate the traps.They also reduce spinal stress, and therefore, may be a better option for those recovering from injury.How to performChestCarrastock/Getty ImagesThe chest comprises two major muscles called the pectoralis major and pectoralis minor.The pectoralis major is split into two parts called the clavicular head, which is the upper chest, and the sternocostal head, which is the lower portion of the chest.The main function of the chest muscles is to bring the arms toward the center of the body, also known as adduction.Chest: incline movements 37. Incline barbell bench pressThe incline barbell bench press is the gold standard for building upper chest mass.A barbell is loaded on an incline bench, slowly unracked, and pressed with a controlled movement, getting a full stretch at the bottom and peak contraction at the top.How to perform38. Incline dumbbell bench pressThe incline dumbbell bench press involves a movement pattern similar to that of the previous exercise, but dumbbells are used instead of a barbell.This allows for more shoulder flexibility and may lead to better muscle contraction for some trainees.How to perform39. Smith machine incline bench pressThe Smith machine bench press utilizes a loaded Smith machine bar for resistance and can be performed either flat or on an incline.This method allows you to isolate the chest muscles by reducing the amount of stabilization needed by accessory muscles. How to perform40. Incline dumbbell flyThe incline dumbbell fly is an excellent upper chest accessory exercise, as it allows for a full stretch at the bottom of the movement. Perform this movement on an adjustable bench set at a slight incline. Grasp a pair of dumbbells in your hands, and while lying on your back, extend your arms down with a slight bend in the elbows, allowing for a full stretch before returning to the starting position.How to perform41. Cable incline flyThe cable incline fly is similar to the dumbbell incline fly, but a cable crossover machine is used for resistance. An incline bench is set up inside a cable crossover, and loaded handles are brought together in a slow and controlled manner, allowing for a full contraction of the upper chest.How to performChest: flat movements42. Barbell bench pressThe flat barbell bench press is a bread-and-butter movement for chest building that uses a loaded barbell set up on a flat bench for resistance.It’s performed by grasping the bar with a medium width grip, unracking the bar, lowering it to your mid-chest with a controlled motion, and pressing up to return it to the starting position.How to perform43. Dumbbell bench pressThe dumbbell bench press involves a movement similar to that of the barbell bench press, but it uses dumbbells for resistance.This allows a greater range of motion resulting in improved isolation of the chest muscles.How to perform44. Machine bench pressThe machine bench press seeks to mimic the movement pattern of the traditional bench press but reduces the amount of stabilization required by other muscle groups, which allows for better isolation of the chest.How to perform45. Dumbbell flyThe dumbbell fly is quite similar to the incline dumbbell fly but uses a flat bench instead of an incline bench.This better targets the lower portion of your chest muscle.How to perform46. Machine chest flyThe machine chest fly uses the same movement pattern as the dumbbell chest fly but provides a more even strength curve, meaning the resistance is more consistent throughout the exercise.How to perform47. Cable flyThe cable fly is unique in that it allows for greater flexibility in the angle at which the exercise is performed. Setting the cables a bit lower will target the upper pecs, while setting the cables slightly higher will hit the lower part of your chest muscles.How to perform48. PushupThe pushup is a classic bodyweight chest exercise that can be a great addition to your home workout program.The arms can be placed a bit wider to target the pecs, or slightly closer to hit the triceps.How to performShouldersSouth_Agency/Getty ImagesThe shoulder muscles, also known as the deltoids, are made up of three distinct heads — the anterior head or front delts, lateral head or side delts, and posterior head or rear delts. The main function of the deltoids is to provide abduction at the shoulder joint, meaning moving the upper arm away and out to the side of your body.The exercises are broken into three categories based on the specific head of the delts that they target. Shoulders: front delts49. Standing shoulder pressThe standing shoulder press is a classic movement for building shoulder mass, particularly for the front delts.This movement is performed by unracking a loaded barbell and pressing it over your head in a controlled motion.How to perform50. Standing dumbbell shoulder pressThe standing dumbbell shoulder press mimics the movement of the barbell press but uses dumbbells for resistance.This allows for greater variability and may help eliminate the wrist discomfort that some people experience with barbells.How to perform51. Seated barbell shoulder pressThe seated barbell shoulder press is quite similar to the standing version, although it relieves some of the trunk muscle from stabilizing the body, allowing for more isolation of the delts. How to perform52. Seated dumbbell shoulder pressThe seated dumbbell shoulder press is a well-known bodybuilding movement for building shoulder mass. This movement is performed on an incline bench set to a nearly upright position. Dumbbells are then pressed above the head in a controlled motion for the desired number of reps.How to perform53. Machine shoulder pressThe machine shoulder press follows a movement pattern similar to those of other shoulder-pressing movements but uses an adjustable weight stack for resistance.Less stabilization is required than is with free-weight shoulder-press exercises, making this a great option for beginners. How to perform54. Smith machine seated shoulder pressThe Smith Machine seated shoulder press is similar to the seated barbell shoulder press, but the bar is fixed on the Smith Machine.Just like the machine shoulder press, this reduces the amount of stabilization required, making the movement slightly easier to perform.How to perform55. Barbell front raiseThe barbell front raise efficiently targets the anterior or front delts. For this movement, a loaded barbell is grasped with an overhand grip and raised to eye level before steadily being returned to the starting position.How to perform56. Dumbbell front raiseThe dumbbell front raise is quite similar to the barbell front raise but uses dumbbells for resistance, allowing slightly more variation.How to performShoulders: side delts57. Dumbbell lateral raiseThe dumbbell lateral raise is one of the more popular exercise selections when looking to hit the side delts. To perform this movement, a dumbbell is held in each hand and raised out to the side of your body with a slight bend in your elbows. The dumbbells are then returned to the starting position in a controlled motion. How to perform58. Cable lateral raiseThe cable lateral raise — like other cable movements — provides a steady resistance curve throughout the movement. This exercise uses a low pulley set up with a single D handle and an appropriate amount of weight. How to perform59. Barbell upright rowThe barbell upright row is an excellent mass builder for the delts when performed correctly. A loaded barbell is grasped with a medium overhand grip and pulled directly upward until your hands reach chest or shoulder height. The weight is then returned to the starting position in a controlled manner. How to perform60. Cable upright rowThe cable upright row is performed in a similar fashion to the previous exercise but uses a straight bar attachment on a cable pulley for consistent resistance throughout the movement.How to perform61. Dumbbell upright rowThe dumbbell upright row provides a bit more variation than the barbell upright row.It’s a great option for those who experience wrist pain when doing the traditional barbell upright row.How to performShoulders: rear delts62. Cable face pullThe cable face pull directly hits the rear delts when performed properly.To perform this movement, set up a cable pulley with a rope attachment at eye level.Pull the rope toward your face while flaring your elbows out to the side, ensuring a full contraction and full stretch during each rep.How to perform63. Seated cable face pullThe seated face pull is the same a the traditional face pull but seated. This takes out some of the required trunk stabilization, making the movement slightly easier and allowing you to fully focus on the muscle contraction.How to perform64. Banded face pullsBanded face pulls follow the same movement pattern as other face pulls but use a band for resistance.These are a great option for workouts taking place at home or in gyms with limited equipment.How to perform65. Dumbbell rear delt lateral raiseThe dumbbell rear delt lateral raise is a favorite exercise among bodybuilders looking to target their rear delts. This movement is performed similarly to a dumbbell lateral raise, but instead of standing straight up, you’re bent over at the waist with a slight bend in the knees, targeting the rear delts.How to perform66. Rear delt machine flyThe rear delt machine fly is a commonly found piece of equipment in most gyms.To perform this movement, sit down facing the chest pad of the machine and making sure the machine arms are adjusted for the rear delt fly. Grab the handles, and with a slight bend in the elbows, extend your arms back until they’re straight out from your torso, or go back further if comfortable, then finally return your arms to the starting position.How to performArmsSouth_Agency/Getty ImagesThe arms comprise a few major muscle groups, including the biceps and the triceps, which make up the musculature of the upper arm, as well as several smaller muscles that make up the forearm.The biceps serve to flex the elbow and facilitate pulling movements, whereas the triceps main function is to extend the elbow joint and perform pushing movements.Meanwhile, the muscles in the forearm facilitate movements of the wrist and hands.The isolation exercises below are broken up into three groups — biceps, triceps, and forearms.Arms: biceps67. Barbell curlThe barbell curl is a classic movement utilized by bodybuilders and recreational athletes alike.To perform the movement, a loaded barbell is grasped with an underhand grip and curled up toward the shoulders while keeping the upper arms parallel to the torso.The weight is then lowered back down in a controlled motion to get a full stretch at the bottom.How to perform68. EZ Bar curlThe EZ bar curl is another popular exercise for bicep mass building, and it’s performed similarly to the barbell curl.The curved bar helps relieve some of the pressure on the wrist joint, making the movement slightly more comfortable to perform than with a barbell. How to perform69. Alternating dumbbell curlThe alternating dumbbell curl is performed with a pair of dumbbells, one in each hand.They’re then curled up, one at a time, and slowly lowered to the starting position.One benefit to this movement is that while one arm is being exercised, the other is at rest, allowing a slight period of recovery between reps.How to perform70. Two-arm dumbbell curlThe two-arm dumbbell curl is similar to the previous movement but instead of alternating arms, you’ll complete the exercise by curling both arms up at once.How to perform71. Hammer curlThe hammer curl is a slight variation of the two-arm dumbbell curl, but instead of using an underhand grip, the dumbbells are held with a neutral grip, meaning your hands face each other.This targets the forearms to a greater extent, as well as the biceps.How to perform72. Cable curlThe cable curl is an excellent exercise for isolating the biceps, as it provides constant tension throughout the movement. The exercise is performed by setting up a low pulley with a straight or EZ curl bar.The bar is then curled up similarly to a barbell curl, making sure to get a peak contraction at the top and a full stretch at the bottom.How to perform73. Incline dumbbell curlThe incline dumbbell curl is a seated variation of the traditional dumbbell curl.This movement utilizes an incline bench set at an approximately 45-degree angle to help further isolate the biceps.While seated, a dumbbell is held in each hand and curled up in an alternating fashion before slowly being lowered back down to the starting position.How to perform74. Dumbbell spider curlThe spider curl is a unique exercise that serves to stimulate a maximal stretch of the biceps at the bottom of the movement. To perform this exercise, you’ll face backward on an incline bench with your arms hanging down over top with a dumbbell in each hand.The dumbbells are then curled all the way up, and in a controlled motion, lowered back down, feeling a full stretch at the bottom.How to perform75. Preacher curlThe preacher curl is another bread-and-butter bicep-building movement.For this exercise, a preacher curl bench is utilized.With the elbows positioned on the pad, an EZ curl bar or pair of dumbbells are grasped with an underhand grip, curled up, and lowered back down with a steady motion.How to perform76. Machine preacher curlThe machine preacher curl is similar to the traditional preacher curl but instead of an EZ curl bar or dumbbells, a weight arm is used for resistance.How to perform77. Drag curlsDrag curls are a unique variation of the traditional barbell curl.The difference is that instead of curling the bar up and out, the bar is held close to your torso all the way to the top of the movement and while releasing it back down.How to perform78. Band curlsBand curls are an excellent curl option for an at-home workout, or even to try something different at the gym.While standing on top of the middle of the band as an anchor, the band handles are grasped with an underhand grip and curled up, then back down, resisting the band tension throughout the movement.How to performArms: triceps79. Cable pushdownThe cable pushdown is a staple in many exercise programs for its ability to efficiently isolate the triceps.This movement is performed on a high cable pulley, most commonly with a straight bar attachment.Facing the pulley and grasping the bar with an overhand grip, the bar is pushed down until just before it reaches your thighs and slowly returned to the starting position, keeping your arms close to your sides.How to perform (rope attachment)80. Cable overhead triceps extensionThe cable overhead extension hits the triceps from a different angle, promoting well-rounded growth throughout. To start, set the cable pulley to about chest height with your choice of rope or straight bar attachment.Grasp the bar with an overhand grip and your back facing the cable pulley, extend your arms up and over your head, pause briefly at the top, and steadily return to the starting position, getting a full stretch at the bottom.How to perform (rope attachment)81. Barbell skull crusherThe barbell skull crusher is a classic mass-building movement for the triceps. To perform this movement, set up a flat bench and load a barbell or EZ curl bar with your working weight. Lie on the bench, extend the loaded bar over your head, and slowly lower the bar down toward your eyes or forehead, feeling a deep stretch at the bottom and returning the bar to the starting position in a controlled fashion.How to perform82. Dumbbell skull crusherThe dumbbell skull crusher is performed similarly to the barbell skull crusher, but dumbbells are used, allowing for more flexibility at the wrists.How to perform83. DipsDips are an excellent bodyweight triceps exercise that also targets the upper chest to a limited extent.To perform this movement, stand facing a dip station or parallel bars. Grasp the bars with your hands facing each other and raise yourself up by pushing with your triceps, then lower yourself down with a controlled motion, feeling a stretch at the bottom.Finally, raise yourself back up, ensuring a full muscle contraction at the top.This movement can also be performed with assistance, which uses a counterweight to make it slightly easier.How to perform84. Machine dipsMachine dips mimic the movement of traditional dips but use a weighted arm for resistance.In addition, this exercise is usually performed seated, allowing you to further isolate the triceps.How to perform85. Machine triceps extensionThe machine triceps extension is a widely available piece of equipment in most gyms.While seated, place your elbows on the pad and grasp the machine handles.Extend your arms down, getting a full muscle contraction at the bottom, and slowly return them up to the starting position, feeling a stretch at the top.How to perform (alternative) 86. Seated EZ bar triceps extensionThe seated EZ bar extension is a free-weight version of the cable tricep extension. While seated, a loaded EZ curl bar is positioned behind the head and extended up, fully contracting the triceps at the top, and lowering it back down to get a full stretch at the end of the movement.How to perform87. Dumbbell kickbacksDumbbell kickbacks are a great finisher exercise for the triceps.To perform this exercise, grasp an appropriate dumbbell in one hand, placing the other hand and one knee on a flat bench.With a flat back, extend the dumbbell up and back using only your tricep muscle, then slowly return it to the starting position.How to perform88. Band tricep pushdownsBand pushdowns are an excellent at-home option for hitting the triceps.This exercise is similar to a cable triceps pushdown, but a band attached to an anchor point is used to provide resistance. How to perform89. Band tricep extensionThe band tricep extension follows the same movement pattern as the cable overhead extension but uses a band for resistance, providing constant tension throughout the movement.How to performArms: forearms90. Barbell wrist curlsThe barbell wrist curl isolates the inside of the forearm that faces your body when standing.To perform this movement, grasp an empty or lightly loaded barbell with an overhand grip and curl it up toward your body, keeping your arms straight and moving only your wrists.How to perform91. Cable wrist curlsThe cable wrist curl is performed in the same fashion as the dumbbell wrist curl, though resistance is provided by a low cable pulley.How to perform92. Wrist rollerThe wrist roller is a fantastic forearm builder that can be made at home.A wooden dowel or metal bar is affixed with a rope, and a small weight is added to the other end.Grasping the bar or dowel with an overhand grip, your arms are extended out in front of you.Reel in the rope by spinning the bar, focusing on working the muscles of the forearm, then reverse the motion, letting the rope back out until it touches the floor.How to perform93. Dumbbell bench wrist curlsTo perform the dumbbell wrist curl, start by kneeling down facing a flat bench.Grasp a light dumbbell and allow your hand and wrist to hang over the side of the bench.Curl the weight up, using only your forearm and getting a full contraction at the top.How to performAbsCasarsa Guru/Getty ImagesThe abs are made up of two main muscle groups — the rectus abdominus and the obliques. The ab muscles play an important role in stabilizing your core and providing movement of the torso. These exercises target the abs from a variety of angles, ensuring full isolation.94. Reaching situpThe reaching situp puts a spin on the traditional situp by having you extend your arms and reach a bit further at the top of the movement, providing a maximal muscle contraction.How to perform95. Rope crunchThe rope crunch is a unique ab exercise that uses a cable weight stack for resistance. To perform this movement, set up a cable pulley with a rope attachment set to medium height.Facing the weight stack, kneel down and grab the ropes in each hand. Crunch down, ensuring you get a full contraction at the bottom and deep stretch at the top.How to perform96. V–upThe V-up takes the traditional crunch and adds a step to make it a bit more challenging.To perform this exercise, lie on your back with your legs straight out.Initiate a crunching motion by raising your legs up and reaching toward your toes in a simultaneous motion, and steadily return to the starting position. How to perform97. Machine crunchThe machine crunch is an alternative to the traditional crunch. It’s performed in a seated position as opposed to lying on your back.To perform the movement, select your desired working weight, and while seated in the machine, reach up to grab the handles. Perform a crunching motion by contracting your abs, then slowly return to the starting position, getting a full stretch at the top.How to perform98. Decline situpThe decline situp is performed on a decline bench, taking the traditional situp and making it much more challenging for maximal ab isolation.How to perform99. Hanging leg raiseTo perform the hanging leg raise, start by hanging from a pullup bar.Raise your legs up as high as possible while keeping them relatively straight, then slowly lower them back down to the hanging position.This movement can also be performed with the knees bent to make it a bit easier.How to perform (knees bent)100. Ab rollerThe ab roller is a commonly found piece of gym equipment that can be used to build significant ab strength.To perform this movement, start on your hands and knees with the ab roller in your hands.Slowly roll the ab roller out until your arms are fully extended, then gradually return to the starting position.How to perform101. Russian twistThe Russian twist is a unique exercise that works both the rectus abdominus and obliques.To start the movement, sit on the floor with a medicine ball or dumbbell in your hands.Raise your legs and twist back and forth, moving the weight from one side of your body to the other for the designated time or reps.How to perform102. PlankThe plank is a static ab exercise usually completed for a set amount of time.To perform a plank, lie on a yoga mat with your elbows supporting your body and legs extended straight back behind you.Hold this position for the desired amount of time, usually 15–30 seconds is a good place to start. How to perform103. Side plankThe side plank is similar to the traditional plank, though for this movement, you’re turned to your side, supporting your body with one arm and isolating the oblique muscles. How to performThe bottom lineThough compound movements may be viewed as superior given that they simulate multiple muscle groups at once, isolation exercises are an equally important part of any strength training program.To create a balanced training program, it’s best to incorporate a variety of exercises for each muscle group, including a mix of compound and isolation movements.As always, it’s important to speak with your medical provider before starting an exercise program, especially if you have any underlying conditions.If you’re unsure about how to tailor your training program to your experience level and needs, consider enlisting the help of a personal trainer.",

Consistent exercise boosts bone health and helps prevent falls, allowing you to maintain independence and enjoy an active lifestyle.Isometric exercises are essential to a well-rounded workout routine to manage osteoporosis. These exercises target specific muscle groups, involving static muscle contractions without any change in muscle length.You can do isometric exercises in short intervals throughout your day or incorporate them into longer workout sessions.Things to considerBefore you begin, consult with a healthcare professional about the best exercises for your needs. Let them know if your pain changes or if you have symptoms such as numbness, tingling, and dizziness. Begin with low intensity exercises and gradually increase the intensity and duration over time. This approach allows your body to adapt and prevents overexertion. Notice how your body feels and adjust the intensity and duration of your workout accordingly. Recognize that your limits can vary from day to day. Feel free to take it down a notch if you feel sore or tired.Prioritize your safety and comfort by modifying or skipping exercises that feel uncomfortable or cause pain.Sample isometric exercise routine for osteoporosisPay attention to your posture and alignment during exercises and throughout the day. Maintain a neutral spine, avoiding excessive bending and twisting. Instead of bending your back, bend at your hips and knees.Practice deep and controlled breathing while you work out and go about your day. This helps stabilize your core, encourages relaxation, and enhances body awareness. Focus your awareness on engaging the targeted muscles for each exercise. This promotes proper form, technique, and muscle activation, maximizing your benefits.Shoulder blade squeezeGif by Dima BazakThis exercise targets your rhomboids and middle trapezius, promoting shoulder stability and mobility. It also helps improve posture and strengthens your upper back.To intensify the exercise, interlace your fingers at the base of your skull with your elbows pointing outward.Sit or stand with a straight back and relaxed shoulders.Lengthen through your spine and broaden your chest. Gently squeeze your shoulder blades together, focusing on the contraction.Hold for up to 30 seconds.Repeat 1–3 times.Wall sitsGif by Dima BazakWall sits target your glutes, quadriceps, and hamstrings, which increases lower body strength, stability, and endurance. Stand with your back against a wall. Place your feet shoulder-width apart.Slide down into a seated position, bending your knees at a 90-degree angle. Hold this position for up to 1 minute.Repeat 1–3 times.Glute bridgeGif by Dima BazakThis exercise activates and strengthens your core, glutes, and hamstrings, encouraging proper posture and overall stability. Lie on your back with your knees bent and feet flat on the floor. Place your arms by your sides, pressing into them for support and resistance.Slowly raise your hips.Form a straight line from your knees to your shoulders. Engage your core muscles.Hold this position for up to 1 minute.Return to the starting position.Repeat 1–3 times. LungeGif by Dima BazakEngaging your glutes, quadriceps, and hamstrings enhances balance, stability, and strength. Lower your back knee to the floor for additional support and stability. Begin by stepping your right foot forward. Lower your body into a lunge position.Bend both knees bent at a 90-degree angle. Hold for up to 30 seconds.Then do the opposite side.Repeat 1–3 times. Plank pose Gif by Dima BazakThe plank strengthens your shoulders, upper back, and core, enhancing balance, stability, and posture.

    "articleTextBody": "When to start exercises for ankle sprainsMost people can start ankle rehabilitation exercises within three days after the ankle injury, if it’s not too severe. But there’s no set timetable. Listen to your own body, and follow your doctor’s advice.For the first few days, you’ll need to rest and apply an ice pack to your injured ankle for 10 to 15 minutes every few hours. Don’t let the ice touch your skin and don’t leave it on so long that it burns you.For many people, the rest period is about three days. After that, you can gradually increase the use of your ankle and begin a program of home exercises or physical therapy.For non-athletes, doctor-prescribed home exercises alone may be just as good as a supervised exercise program. A 2007 study of 102 people who had sprained ankles showed no major difference to recovery after one year from a supervised exercise program compared to standard care with unsupervised home exercises. Discuss rehabilitation exercises with your doctor and do your own research to help you decide which treatment is best for you. Types of exercises for a sprained anklerange of motionstretchingstrengtheningbalance and controlAnkle range of motion exercisesThese exercises are simple motions you can do up to 5 times per day that can help you maintain your range of motion and flexibility in your ankle.1. Ankle alphabetSit on a couch or comfortable chair. Extend your leg out and trace the letters of the alphabet in the air with your big toe. If there’s no pain, you can repeat this 2 or 3 times. This gentle exercise helps you to move your ankle in all directions.2. Knee motionSit in a chair with your foot flat on the floor. Keeping your foot on the floor, slowly move your knee from side to side for 2 to 3 minutes. This stretches and relaxes the ligaments around your ankle.3. Towel and tissue scrunchesPlace a small towel on the floor in front of you while you sit in a hard chair. With your shoes and socks off, gently grab the towel with your toes, scrunch it up, and count to 5. Then release the towel and repeat. Do this 8 to 10 times— or less if you feel pain. You can also try this with a tissue.Ankle stretching exercisesYour Achilles tendon attaches the muscles of your calf to your heel bone, passing behind your ankle. Stretching your Achilles tendon is the next set of exercises to take up as soon as you can. 4. Towel stretchSit on the floor with your leg stretched out in front of you. Wrap a towel or strap around the ball of your foot. Pull back on the towel so your toes move toward you. Hold the stretch for 15 to 30 seconds. Don’t over do it. You only need to feel a mild to moderate stretch on your calf muscle. 5. Standing calf stretchStand facing a wall or in front of a countertop and put your hands on it for support. Place your injured ankle about one step back and your good foot forward. Keeping your back heel flat on the floor, slowly bend the knee of your good leg until you feel a moderate stretch in the calf on your injured side. Repeat this 3 times, holding for 30 seconds. 6. Heel raiseStand with your hands in front of you, resting against a wall, countertop, or chair back for support. With your feet shoulder width apart, slowly rise up on your toes and come back down. Do about 10 of these at first and work up to 20 or more. Remember, you only want a moderate stretch and no pain. When these become easy, you can switch to doing it only with the toes on your injured side. 7. One-leg balanceWith your hands on a wall, countertop, or chair back, lift up your good leg behind you so that your weight rests on the leg with the injured ankle. Try to hold this for 20 to 30 seconds. As you get stronger, try doing it only with the support of one or two fingers. When you’re stronger, do this without holding on. Ankle strengthening exercisesOnce you have a good range of motion and can comfortably bear weight on your sprained ankle, it’s time for the next step — strengthening exercises. These exercises require a resistance band. This is a simple elastic band that you can get from a sporting goods store, online, or a physical therapist’s office.8. Elastic band pushThis is a variation of the towel stretch, but with resistance. Sit on the floor. Prop up your ankle with a rolled-up towel or swimming noodle to keep your heel off the floor. Place the elastic band around the ball of your foot and hold the two ends. Now slowly push your ankle forward like you’re pointing your toe. Then slowly bring it back. Repeat this 10 times. Don’t use the band if there is any pain, or if your ankle feels wobbly. 9. Elastic band pullTie your resistance band around a heavy object such as a desk or table leg. While sitting on the floor, hook your toes and upper foot into the band. Now, slowly pull your foot back towards you and return it to vertical position. Repeat this 10 times. 10. Ankle outTie your resistance band around a heavy object. Sit or stand and hook the inside of your foot into the end of the band. Slowly move your foot to the outside and back. Repeat 10 times at first, and build up to 20 times.You can also do this while sitting down with your ankle propped up on a rolled towel or noodle. Tie a loop in the end of the resistance band and hook it around your foot. Now arrange the band to also go around your good foot. Your good foot acts as a pivot. Holding on to the end of the band, turn your ankle out. Repeat 10 times at first, and build up to 20 times.11. Ankle inWith the resistance band tied around a heavy object, hook the inside of your foot into the band. Now slowly move your foot inward against the resistance band and bring it back. Repeat 10 times, and build up to 20 times.Ankle balance and control exercisesA key part of rehab is regaining control of your muscles. When you have a sprain, nerve fibers are damaged. As you recover strength, your brain has to regain its sense of where your ankle is and how precisely to move it. This sense is called proprioception.12. Basic balanceStand on your injured foot, lift the other foot off the floor behind you, and try to maintain your balance. Use a countertop or chair back for support if you feel unsteady. Try to hold this for a few seconds at first. Then build up to 30 seconds and 1 minute, if you can. 13. Balance with eyes closedNow repeat the basic balance exercise with your eyes closed. This is much harder, because you don’t have visual points of reference to help you balance. Be sure to have something for support. Again, try to work up to 30 seconds and 1 minute, if you can.14. Pillow balanceDo the same basic balance exercise while standing on a pillow. This is much harder. Even if your ankle isn’t sprained, your foot will wobble around a lot and you’ll constantly need to correct your balance. See if you can get to 30 seconds to 1 minute. Stop if you begin to feel pain in your ankle. 15. Pillow balance with eyes closedThis is the most challenging exercise. See how long you can hold your balance while standing on a pillow with your eyes closed. Be sure to have something available for support. Work up to 30 seconds to 1 minute if you can. But don’t be discouraged if you can’t. With these exercises you’re retraining and improving the signals between your ankle and your brain. About using bracesYour doctor will prescribe a type of ankle brace depending on the type and severity of your sprain. In the past, hard casts were often used. But research showed that these slowed down recovery in many cases. Now braces are used.The three types of ankle braces are: lace-up ankle bracesstirrup ankle braceselastic ankle bracesYou might also use an elastic bandage and learn how to do compression wrapping to support your injured ankle.Each of these adds to stability while your sprain is healing. Depending on the brace design, it can also reduce swelling in the early stages.If you have a very severe sprain, your doctor may apply a short leg cast for two to three weeks. Repeat sprained anklesIf you have repeated ankle sprains, ankle stabilization surgery may be an option, especially if conservative treatment like braces and exercises haven’t helped. There’s evidence that surgery can provide longer-lasting relief and lower the relapse rate more than conventional treatment for people with repeated ankle injuries.The takeawayAnkle sprains are very common. The severity can vary greatly. Sometimes you will not know that you sprained it until a few hours later when you see swelling or bruising, and feel increased pain. You should seek treatment even for minor sprains. Your doctor will determine the best type of brace to use and prescribe an exercise program to suit your specific needs. You can usually begin movement or very light exercises within three days of the injury. Recovery time depends on the severity of the sprain, your age, and your general physical health.",

    "articleTextBody": "Some stretching and strengthening exercises may help correct rounded shoulders, muscle imbalances, and posture. These can be performed standing, sitting, or lying down.Everyday activities like sitting, exercising, driving, and standing could make us round our shoulders. Bad posture from rounded shoulders may trigger everything from neck, head, and lower back pain to decreased range of motion and poor circulation. Austin Martinez, MS, CSCS, ATC, director of education for StretchLab, said the rounded shoulder position is often associated with “upper crossed syndrome.” This condition is characterized by tight chest muscles (pectoralis major/minor) and neck/shoulder muscles (levator scapulae).Fortunately, some exercises and stretches could help improve your posture. Here are 6 moves to open up your chest, relax your shoulders, and correct your posture. Lateral neck flexion stretch Martinez said this stretch targets the trapezius and scalene muscles, which play a role in posture and breathing throughout the neck and shoulders.Stand or sit upright in a chair with your shoulders down and back.Gently pull your left ear toward your left shoulder to get a stretch in the right side of your neck. Repeat on the other side. Complete 1 to 2 sets on each side, holding for 15 to 30 seconds.Chest doorway stretch The doorway stretch is a top pick for rounded shoulders, said John Gallucci, Jr., DPT, MS, ATC, physical therapist and CEO of JAG-ONE Physical Therapy. This move opens the chest while gently stretching the shoulders.Stand with a doorway about 1 to 2 feet in front of you. Bend both your elbows to 90 degrees and raise your arms so your upper arms are parallel to the floor. Place your forearms on either side of the doorway. Step forward, placing one foot on the other side of the doorway.Slowly shift weight onto the front foot until you feel a stretch in your chest. Hold.Complete 3 sets for 15 to 30 seconds each, two to three times daily.Reverse shoulder stretch The reverse shoulder stretch opens up the chest and stretches the shoulders and biceps. However, it requires shoulder flexibility, so shorten the range of motion if you feel pain while performing this stretch. Stand looking straight ahead, feet shoulder-width apart and arms by your sides. Clasp your hands behind your back with thumbs pointing toward the floor.Stand tall, open your chest, and move your hands back and toward the ceiling. Stop when you feel a stretch in the shoulders and biceps muscles.Hold this position for 20 to 30 seconds. Release the stretch and return hands to the starting position. Complete 2 sets, holding 20 to 30 seconds each, once or twice daily. Prone I, T, YProne Y positionThe prone I, T, Y exercise helps strengthen the smaller stabilizing muscles in your shoulders and upper back.Lie on your stomach, forehead touching the ground, arms straight above your head, and hands in a thumbs-up position. Raise your arms as high as you can, pause, and then slowly lower them back down.Move arms out into a “Y” position, raise them as high as possible, and slowly lower them back down. Move arms out into a “T” position, raise them as high as possible, and slowly lower them back down. Return to the “I” position and repeat.Complete 2 sets of 10 reps, once or twice daily. Band pull-apartThe band pull-apart exercise opens up the chest and strengthens your upper back and rear shoulder muscles. For this exercise, you’ll need a resistance band. The band strength depends on your strength level.Stand upright with back straight, feet shoulder-width apart, and knees slightly bent.Hold the band with an overhand grip and your arms straight out in front of you. Slowly pull your hands apart by squeezing your shoulder blades together.Focus on the squeeze by imagining a small ball between your shoulder blades. Slowly return the band to the starting position. Complete 2 sets of 10 to 12 reps, once or twice daily. Scapular wall slidesScapular wall slides help restore scapula alignment and improve muscle strength, mobility, and flexibility. They also train you to hold your shoulder blades back.Stand with your back against a wall, arms at your sides. Make sure your head, upper back, and glutes are in contact with the wall. Your feet will be slightly away from the wall. Raise your arms overhead and press them into the wall, palms out with knuckles touching the wall. Bend the elbows to 90 degrees while keeping arms against the wall. This is the starting position.From this position, slowly slide your arms up the wall as high as you can go without your back, shoulders, elbows, or wrists coming off the wall.Pause at the top of the movement. Slowly lower your arms by sliding them down the wall to the starting position (elbows bent at 90 degrees). This movement is slow and controlled. Complete 2 sets of 10 reps once or twice daily. Are there any other treatments I can try to help correct rounded shoulders?First-line treatment for correcting rounded shoulders includes stretching and strengthening. Beyond that, Gallucci said soft tissue mobilization by a physical therapist can loosen the tight muscles in the chest region, which may occur due to the hunched-over position. You may also benefit from wearing a shoulder posture brace, which keeps your neck and shoulders in the correct position. A doctor or physical therapist could assist in fitting one that works for you.Are there exercises I should avoid if I have rounded shoulders?Gallucci said you don’t need to avoid specific exercises as long as you’re not experiencing pain or discomfort. What he does recommend, however, is stretching and strengthening.“Hunched or rounded shoulders are most often experienced due to a muscle imbalance between the chest and shoulder/upper back region,” said Gallucci. To correct the imbalance, he said stretching and strengthening should target the chest and upper back, not specifically one or the other. When performing exercises, ensure your spine is straight and you’re not hunching over.\n{\n  \"@context\": \"https://schema.org\",\n  \"@type\": \"FAQPage\",\n  \"mainEntity\": [{\n    \"@type\": \"Question\",\n    \"name\": \"Can rounded shoulders be corrected?\",\n    \"acceptedAnswer\": {\n      \"@type\": \"Answer\",\n      \"text\": \"In most cases, strength exercises and stretches that target the core, chest, and back could help correct rounded shoulders.

    "articleTextBody": "You may be able to improve mobility in your shoulders with stretches, such as the cross-arm stretch, and exercises with and without weights. These can include rows and arm swings.Whether you have tightness in your shoulders, are recovering from an injury, or simply want to boost the strength of your shoulder muscles, there are specific stretches and exercises that can be especially beneficial. Including shoulder-specific exercises and stretches in your overall workout program may help increase your shoulder mobility and flexibility. These movements may also build strength in your shoulders, improve your shoulder function, and prevent injury. Keep reading to learn more about the shoulder exercises and stretches that may help boost your functional fitness and make it easier to move your shoulders. Mobility vs. flexibilityMobility and flexibility are often used interchangeably, but they’re not the same thing, says Alan Snyder PT, DPT.Flexibility refers to the muscle’s ability to lengthen. Mobility, on the other hand, is the ability of the joint to move through its full range of motion. While they both refer to the overall range of motion in the shoulder, it’s important to know where the limitation is coming from.“As a physical therapist, joint mobility and the actual biomechanics of the ball and socket joint tend to play a much bigger role in dysfunction,” explains Snyder. Shoulder mobility exercisesPerforming shoulder-specific exercises, like the ones outlined below, can help build strength and mobility in your shoulder muscles and joints. These exercises may also help prevent tightness and subsequent injury.Before you do any of these exercises, spend 5 to 10 minutes warming up with dynamic upper body stretches such as arm circles, arm swings, and spinal rotations. “Warming up this way is great for increasing blood flow to a specific area, which also helps with overall performance,” explains Snyder.If you’re recovering from a shoulder injury or surgery, work with a physical therapist who can help you do the right exercises and stretches for your condition. 1. Standing arm swingsThis is a great dynamic exercise that helps to increase blood flow to the shoulder joint. Doing this exercise as part of a warmup before performing upper body exercises can improve mobility and flexibility in your shoulders and upper back. To do this exercise:Stand tall with your arms by your sides. Engage your core and swing your arms forward until they’re as high as you can go. Make sure you don’t raise your shoulders.Return your arms to the starting position and repeat. Do this movement for 30 to 60 seconds.2. Shoulder pass-throughThe shoulder pass-through exercise helps to increase joint mobility while still engaging the surrounding muscles of the shoulder. This exercise requires a holding a long stick, like a broomstick or PVC pipe.To do this exercise: Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and your arms in front of your body.Hold a stick, like a broomstick or PVC pipe, with an overhand grip. Your arms will be wider than shoulder-width. Make sure the stick or pipe is parallel to the floor. Engage your core and slowly raise the broomstick or pipe above your head, keeping your arms straight. Only go as far as comfortable.Hold the pose for a few seconds. Return to the starting position.Repeat 5 times.3. High-to-low rowsAccording to Snyder, hi-to-low rows really challenge the upper back and thoracic muscles, which provide a lot of stability to the shoulder joint. This exercise requires a resistance band. You can also do this exercise at the gym using a cable machine. To do this exercise: Secure a resistance band to a sturdy object above shoulder height. Kneel down on one knee and grab the band with the opposite hand. The other hand can rest at your side. Pull the band toward your body while keeping your torso and arm straight. Focus on squeezing the shoulder blades together. Return to the starting position and repeat. Do 2–3 sets of 10 repetitions on each side. 4. Reverse flyLike the high-to-low rows, the reverse fly exercise targets the upper back and thoracic muscles that provide a lot of stability to the shoulder joint. This exercise requires a set of light dumbbells. To do this exercise: Hold a dumbbell in each hand. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, knees slightly bent. Engage your core and bend forward at the waist. Keep your back straight. Your arms will be extended. Raise your arms away from your body. Focus on squeezing your shoulder blades together. Stop when you get to shoulder height. Slowly return to the starting position and repeat. Do 3 sets of 10 repetitions. 5. Rotation with dumbbellRotation with a dumbbell allows you to warm up the shoulder for overhead and throwing motions. According to Snyder, this is standard practice for most athletes who extend their arms overhead and externally rotate during their sport.To do this exercise: Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart while holding a light dumbbell in your right hand.Raise your arm so your elbow is at shoulder height. The front of your hand will be facing the ground. Rotate your shoulder to bring your arm and weight up so your hand is raised toward the ceiling. Slowly return to the starting position and repeat before changing sides. Do 2–3 sets of 12 repetitions on each arm. Shoulder mobility stretchesThe main benefit of stretching the shoulder, says Snyder, is to prevent injury to the muscles and joints. Since the stretches listed below fall under the category of static stretches, consider doing them after a workout or immediately following a warmup that includes dynamic stretches. 6. Cross-arm stretchThe cross-arm stretch targets the rotator cuff muscles. You should feel a good stretch in the rear shoulders.To do this stretch: Stand with your feet slightly less than shoulder-width apart and bring your right arm up to a little less than shoulder height.Place your left hand on your right elbow and gently pull your right arm across your body using the left hand to support your arm.Hold this position for up to 30 seconds. Repeat on the opposite side. Do each side 3–5 times. 7. Sleeper stretchSnyder likes the sleeper stretch because it’s an excellent way to work internal rotation for the shoulder.This stretch is often recommended when dealing with a shoulder injury or during rehab.While you can do this stretch on both sides for general health, if you have an injury, the emphasis should be on the affected side. To do this stretch: Lie on the affected side. If you have no injury or pain, choose a side to start with. Your shoulder should be stacked underneath you. Bring your elbow straight out from your shoulder and bend this arm, so your fingers are pointing toward the ceiling. This is the starting position. Gently guide this arm toward the floor using the unaffected arm. Stop when you feel a stretch in the back of your affected shoulder. Hold this position for up to 30 seconds. Do 3 repetitions before changing sides. 8. Doorway stretchThe doorway stretch allows you to stretch each side of your chest individually, which helps if one side is tighter than the other. This stretch helps to open the pectoralis muscles in your chest and increases the range of motion in your shoulders. To do this stretch: Stand in a doorway with elbows and arms forming a 90-degree angle. Your feet should be in a split stance.Bring your right arm up to shoulder height and place your palm and forearm on the doorway. Gently lean into the stretch, only going as far as comfortable. Hold the stretch for up to 30 seconds. Change sides and repeat. Perform on each side 2–3 times. 9. Chest expansionChest expansion is a good way to stretch your back muscles, open your chest, and increase range of motion in your shoulders. Snyder says it can also help expand your lungs to receive oxygen better.To do this stretch: Stand tall with your feet together.Hold the end of a towel or exercise band in each hand, with your arms behind your body.Use the towel or band to help move your shoulder blades together and open your chest. This will cause you to look toward the ceiling. Hold this pose for up to 30 seconds. Repeat 3–5 times. 10. Child’s PoseCommonly known as a yoga move, Snyder says Child’s Pose is a good way to open the shoulder joint into flexion (forward bending) and to stretch your latissimus dorsi, or lat, muscles. Your lower back can also benefit from this pose. To do this stretch: Kneel on an exercise mat. Make sure your body is upright. Slowly crawl your hands forward until your arms are extended in front of you. Keep your gaze downward. Lower your torso onto your thighs and your forehead on the ground. Hold this position while taking three deep breaths. Repeat 3–5 times. Safety tipsTo keep your shoulder mobility exercises safe and effective, keep these tips in mind.Stop if you feel any pain. Slight discomfort is normal, but you shouldn’t feel sharp pain while you’re doing these exercises or stretches. Stop right away if you experience pain.Remember to breathe.

    "articleTextBody": "TMJ pain may go away on its own. But specific exercises and other doctor-recommended practices, such as wearing a mouth guard, may help fix the issue sooner.You may not think about your temporomandibular joints (TMJ) much, but you use them often. The joints connect your jawbone to your skull. Your TMJ springs into action each time you talk, chew, and swallow.Temporomandibular disorders occur when something affects your jaw joints and jaw muscles. Often, this happens because of a jaw injury, inflammation such as with arthritis, or overuse.TMJ disorders may cause mild to debilitating symptoms, such as:pain while chewingpain in the ear, face, jaw, and neckclicking, grating, or popping sounds in the jaw when you open or close your mouthlocking of the jaw jointheadachesExercises for TMJ pain reliefozgurcankaya/Getty ImagesTMJ exercises may relieve pain by:strengthening and stretching jaw musclesrelaxing jaw tensionincreasing TMJ mobilityDoctors may manually manipulate your jaw to stretch and strengthen muscles as part of physical therapy. However, certain home exercises may help relieve TMJ pain and improve the movement of your jaw joints.Relaxed jaw exerciseRest your tongue gently on the roof of your mouth behind your upper front teeth.Allow your teeth to come apart while relaxing your jaw muscles.Open your mouth to a comfortable size and repeat.You may experience popping or cracking sounds when opening your mouth fully.Goldfish exercises (partial opening)Place your tongue on the roof of your mouth.Place one finger in front of your ear where your TMJ is located.Put your middle or pointer finger on your chin.Drop your lower jaw halfway and then close it. There should be mild resistance but not pain.A variation of this exercise is to place one finger on each TMJ as you drop your lower jaw halfway and close again.Goldfish exercises (full opening)Press your tongue on the roof of your mouthPlace one finger on your TMJ and another finger on your chin.Relax the jaw and open your mouth while keeping your tongue in place.Open your mouth fully, close, and repeat.For a variation of this exercise, place one finger on each TMJ as you completely drop your lower jaw and back. Do this exercise six times to complete one set. You should complete one set six times daily. Chin tucksSit or stand with your shoulders back and chest up.Pull your chin straight back and down toward the chest, creating a “double chin.”Hold for three seconds and repeat 10 times.This exercise can stretch the TMJ without opening the mouth, so it can be useful for those with discomfort during jaw movements.Resisted opening of the mouthPlace your thumb under your chin.Open your mouth slowly, pushing gently against your chin for resistance.Hold for three to six seconds, and then close your mouth slowly.Repeat 10 times.Adding resistance to stretching exercises can help increase muscle strength.Resisted closing of the mouthSqueeze your chin with your index and thumb with one hand.Close your mouth as you place gentle pressure on your chin. Repeat 10 times.This will help strengthen the muscles that help you chew.Side-to-side jaw movementPut a ¼ inch object, such as a stacked tongue depressor, between your front teethSlowly move your jaw from side to side. Hold for 2–3 seconds at the end of each movement.Repeat 10 times on each side.As the exercise becomes easier, increase the object’s thickness between your teeth by stacking them one on top of each other.Forward jaw movementPut a ¼ inch of object between your front teeth.Move your bottom jaw forward so your bottom teeth are in front of your top teeth.Hold for 2–3 seconds on each side of the movement.Repeat 10 times.As the exercise becomes easier, increase the object’s thickness between your teeth. Other ways to manage your TMJ painOver-the-counter pain relievers such as ibuprofen and acetaminophen may help relieve TMJ pain. Muscle relaxers may be prescribed for severe pain. Doctors may also recommend:mouth guards to prevent teeth grinding and jaw clenchingmouth guards to help realign your jawwarm or cold compressesstress-relief techniques to help prevent behaviors that cause jaw tensionTMJ pain may also be managed with simple lifestyle changes. You may wish to:avoid clenching your teetheat a soft diet to allow the TMJ to relaxavoid chewing gumavoid biting your nailsavoid biting your lower lippractice good posturelimit large jaw movements, such as yawning and singingSevere pain from damaged joints may require more invasive treatments, such as corticosteroid injections into the TMJ. Surgery is a last resort option in many cases but may be the only applicable treatment in cases of tumors and joint fusion.The bottom lineIn some cases, TMJ disorders go away on their own. If your symptoms persist, TMJ exercises may help bring pain relief.When doing TMJ exercises, start slowly. You may feel some pain at first, but it should be tolerable and gradually improve. If the pain isn’t tolerable, consult your doctor. You should do TMJ exercises when you’re relaxed.If your pain worsens after doing TMJ exercises, visit your doctor.",

The key is to focus on high intensity workouts that quickly increase your heart rate.High-intensity interval training, or HIIT, is a popular way to do this. It involves short bursts of exercise at more than 70 percent of your aerobic capacity.One HIIT method involves alternating between 30-second speed and 1-minute rest intervals. High intensity workouts can burn a lot of calories in 30 minutes or less.Try these exercises to burn a lot of calories when you’re on a time crunch. Or perform them as part of a circuit training routine.High-knee runningCalories burned in 1 minute:3.5 to 7High-knee running is a vigorous cardio workout that raises your heart rate while strengthening your lower body. As a high intensity exercise, it is useful for burning calories quickly.To do this exercise:Run in place while lifting your knees as high as possible.Quickly pump your arms up and down.Butt kicksCalories burned in 1 minute:8 to 12Butt kicks are a cardio workout, just like high-knee running. You can quickly burn calories within 30 minutes by doing butt kicks at a high intensity.To do this exercise:Lift one heel toward your butt.Repeat with the other heel.Rapidly alternate your heels while pumping your arms.Mountain climbersCalories burned in 1 minute:7 to 12The  is a cardio exercise that doubles as a full-body workout. Since you use your entire body, you burn a lot of calories in a short period of time.To do this exercise:Start in a plank position. Place your shoulders over your hands.Engage your core. Lift your right knee toward your chest.Return to plank. Repeat with your left knee.Repeat quickly.SwimmingCalories burned in 30 minutes:198 to 294Swimming is a low impact workout that burns energy while improving:muscle strengthblood flowlung and heart capacityThirty minutes of casual swimming burns about the same number of calories as 30 minutes of jogging.However, swimming causes less stress on the body. It may be an appropriate exercise for people with joint pain or limited mobility.Do laps or water aerobics to increase your caloric burn during swimming.Stationary bicyclingCalories burned in 30 minutes:210 to 311Try intervals of high intensity cycling if you have access to a stationary bike. As a vigorous cardio workout, stationary bicycling can burn a significant number of calories in 30 minutes.Start with a five-minute warmup and alternate between one-minute speed and two-minute recovery intervals. On a scale from 0 to 10, your speed intervals should be 7 to 9, and your recovery intervals should be 5 to 6.SprintsCalories burned in 1 minute:15 to 22Generally, running is the best calorie-burning exercise. But if you don’t have enough time to go on a run, you can shorten your workout into high intensity sprints. Your body will rapidly burn calories to fuel your workout.You can try to do 3 sets of 100 meter sprints 3 times to complete a 30-minute workout, or another form of sprint interval training.Make sure you warm up by doing jumping jacks or high-knee running before sprinting.At-home calorie-burning exercisesIf you’re at home and don’t have gym equipment, you can still do high-calorie-burning exercises.The HIIT bodyweight workouts listed above can be done at home. Exercises like high-knee running, butt kicks, and mountain climbers require limited space.In addition to HIIT, the following workouts are excellent for burning calories.WalkingCalories burned per minute:3.1 to 4.6 Walking is the simplest way to burn calories at home.

Weight training, or strength training, is also important.Compared to a session of weight training, cardio typically burns more calories in a single session. However, weight training increases muscle mass, which burns more calories than fat.The more calories you’ll burn at rest the more muscle you have. This means your body will burn more calories over time, even when you’re sleeping or sitting at your desk.A fitness regimen that includes both cardio and weight training will maximize your individual calorie burn.Warm up and cool downAlways warm up before doing cardio. This will increase your body temperature and blood flow, which prepares your body for exercise. It also reduces your risk of injury.Consider doing modified exercises if you have: an injurylimited mobilitycertain health conditions (like arthritis)Additionally, cooling down is also an important part of your workout. It allows your heart rate to gradually decrease, instead of stopping quickly, which can lead to feeling sick or passing out.Talk with a doctor, personal trainer, or physical therapist. These specialists can demonstrate how to safely perform calorie-burning exercises and recommend other modifications and moves for your goals.How to get startedBefore starting a new exercise plan, talk with your doctor first. Your doctor can suggest the best type of exercise for your current health and fitness level. They will also explain any safety measures you should take.For example, if you have type 1 diabetes, you’ll need to monitor your blood glucose levels during and after exercise.When you’re ready to start a workout regimen, begin with:simple, basic moveslow repslow weightsThis will minimize your risk of pain and injury.Consider working with a certified personal trainer if weight loss is your goal.

    "articleTextBody": "You may be able to fix or correct your posture over time with a combination of yoga, stretching, and exercises designed to stretch and lengthen the spine. Having good posture is about more than looks. It helps you to develop strength, flexibility, and balance in your body. These can all lead to less muscle pain and more energy throughout the day. Proper posture can also reduce stress on your muscles and ligaments, which can reduce your risk of injury.There may even be mental health benefits. A 2017 study suggests that upright posture can help increase positive affect, decrease negative self-focus, and reduce fatigue in people with mild-to-moderate depression. A 2018 study found that adopting an expansive posture may also improve body-related emotions, including body image satisfaction and self-appraisal.Ready to get started? Read on to learn how to do 12 exercises that’ll help you sit a little taller. 1. Child’s PoseGif by Active Body. Creative Mind.Child’s pose stretches and lengthens your spine, glutes, and hamstrings.

    "articleTextBody": "Bodyweight training is a popular and accessible method of improving your strength and conditioning with minimal to no equipment.When it comes to building stronger legs, bodyweight training offers you a variety of options to target the muscles in your lower body.Getty ImagesTypes of bodyweight leg exercisesMost variations of bodyweight leg exercises fall into one of the two following movement patterns:squat patternlunge patternWithin each of these movement patterns, certain exercises allow you to progress and improve your strength without relying on much, if any, external equipment.Meanwhile, many other bodyweight leg exercises don’t neatly fit into these patterns. A few of these options are included after the squat and lunge pattern movements to add variety, warm up, and help improve your overall mobility.SummarySquats and lunges are the primary movement patterns available for bodyweight leg training. Additional exercises can be added for more variety and comprehensive training.Squat form and variationsThe squat is arguably the king of lower body exercises. When it comes to building stronger hips and legs, squat variations are must-have exercises in your workout program.Muscles trained with the squatThe squat movement pattern primarily trains the following muscles:quadricepsgluteus maximuscalves (soleus and gastrocnemius)hamstringsSquat exercises also require core stabilization, so you will strengthen the muscles of your core as well.Bodyweight squat exercises have easier and harder variations.If you’re new to training your legs, beginning with a chair squat is the best option.If you have some training, a standard bodyweight squat provides an excellent method for leg training with just bodyweight.For more advanced fitness practitioners, performing a jump squat can provide the extra challenge you may need for a good bodyweight leg workout.Standard bodyweight squatThe classic standard bodyweight squat can be performed virtually anywhere. You can wear standard workout shoes or even bare feet when performing this exercise (1).To perform the bodyweight squat:Stand with your feet around shoulder-width apart and turned out 5–12 degrees.Begin the motion by moving your hips backward, sitting back, and lowering your hips. Reach your arms out in front for counterbalance.As you sit back, generate tension in your feet and legs by imagining you’re pushing your knees outward and sitting down between your thighs, as opposed to on top of them. This is to counteract the tendency to let your knees cave or turn inward.Lower your hips until the tops of your thighs are parallel to the floor. You can go lower if your mobility allows.Once you reach the bottom position, push through each foot evenly to stand up to the starting position.Keep your knees pointing in the same direction as your toes throughout the entire range of motion.Your torso should be roughly at the same angle as your shins throughout the motion. This means that you’ll lean slightly forward as you squat down, and your knees will move slightly forward as well.When you’re first learning the bodyweight squat, start at a slow speed and practice before increasing your tempo.For an optimal baseline breathing pattern, inhale as you lower down and exhale as you drive up to return to the start position.If squatting until your thighs are parallel to the floor is too difficult, or if you cannot maintain the proper form without your knees turning in or leaning too much with your torso, squat to just above parallel or start with the chair squat instead.Chair squatThe chair squat is the best option if you’re just learning how to properly perform a bodyweight squat. For this exercise, a sturdy, standard-size kitchen chair is the best choice.Chair squats are great if you’re still getting used to the feeling of sitting backward with your hips. The chair gives you the security that you’ll not fall backward and offers a reference point so you know when you hit the bottom of the squat.If you find yourself losing balance on a normal bodyweight squat, train with the chair squat to build the proper control and movement pattern.If you don’t have a chair, a flat-topped surface around 18 inches (45.7 cm) high will work.To perform a chair squat:Position a chair of around 18 inches (45.7 cm) high behind you.Stand about 1 foot (30.5 cm) in front of the chair, with your feet around shoulder-width apart and turned out 5–12 degreesBegin the motion by moving your hips backward, sitting back, and lowering your hips.As you sit back, generate tension in your feet and legs by imagining you’re pushing your knees outward and sitting down between your thighs, as opposed to on top of them. This is to counteract your knees’ tendency to cave in or turn inward.Lower your hips until your hips touch the chair. Don’t sit down on the chair.As soon as you feel your hips contact the chair, push through each foot evenly to stand up to the starting position.Keep your knees pointing in the same direction as your toes throughout the entire range of motion.Your torso should be roughly at the same angle as your shins throughout the motion. This means that you’ll lean slightly forward as you squat down, and your knees will move slightly forward as well.After a few weeks of doing the chair squats as part of your workout, you may feel ready to try the standard bodyweight squat. Jump squatOnce you’re confident with your bodyweight squat, you can progress to a variation called the jump squat (also called a squat jump) to add intensity to your bodyweight leg training (2).The jump squat is remarkably like the bodyweight squat. However, instead of steadily standing up to the top position, you explosively drive through the floor and fully extend your feet to jump off the floor. As you land, absorb your weight by squatting back down using the same technique.The jump squat is considered a plyometric exercise, which means that it utilizes the natural elasticity of your muscles and connective tissue to help with the explosive movement (3).Plyometric exercises are incredibly demanding on your body, so be sure you can safely and comfortably perform multiple sets of standard squats before attempting the jump squat.To perform the jump squat:Stand with your feet around shoulder-width apart and turned out 5–12 degrees.Begin the motion by moving your hips backward, sitting back, and lowering your hips. Reach your arms out in front for counterbalance and swing them backward at the bottom to generate momentum for the jump.Lower your hips until the tops of your thighs are parallel to the floor.Once you reach the bottom position, explosively drive through each foot and rapidly stand back up. In the same motion, extend your feet and push through your toes to completely clear the floor and jump off the ground. Throw your arms upward as you leave the ground.As you land, absorb your weight by squatting right back down using the same technique.Keep your knees pointing in the same direction as your toes throughout the entire range of motion.If performing for repetitions, the landing absorption becomes the initial downward squat movement for the next jump squat repetition.To safely jump squat, you must ensure your knees track in-line with your toes the whole time. The jump squat should only be performed once you’re confident with the bodyweight squat.SummarySquats are a must-have exercise in your leg training program. There are progression options for increasing or decreasing the difficulty depending on your fitness level.Lunge form and variationsAlongside the squat, the lunge is a foundational lower body movement pattern that offers several exercise options.The lunge pattern forms the basis of a wide range of movements in both athletic activities and everyday life, such as walking and running.Muscles trained with the lungeThe lunge primarily targets the following muscles:quadricepshamstringsglutesSince lunges have a high requirement for stabilization, they’ll work your core and glutes in a different manner than the squat exercises. Training lunge pattern movements will quickly improve your balance and stability.If you’re very new to fitness, the basic lunge will challenge your coordination and strength. Start slowly and focus on the movement and balance itself.Soon, you’ll be comfortable performing standard bodyweight lunges and be ready to try split lunges and jump lunges.Standard bodyweight lungeThe standard bodyweight lunge is the first lunge variation you should learn.To perform the standard bodyweight lunge:Begin standing with your feet hip-width apart.Take a large step forward. The exact distance will depend on your body size but should be roughly 2–3 times the distance of a normal walking step. Your front foot should be pointing directly forward. Your back foot will be turned out very slightly.Lower your hips by slowly bringing your back knee toward the ground. Actively rotate your back foot inward and raise your back heel as you lower your knee for optimal movement. Your front knee will bend as your center of mass lowers.Continue lowering your body until your back knee is just off the ground. At the bottom of the lunge, your front shin should be perpendicular to the floor or angled forward slightly.Push through your front foot to stand straight back up to the starting position.You can alternate legs each repetition or stay in the staggered stance and perform one side all the way through before switching.If you find yourself losing balance, be sure that your feet stay hip-width apart even once you take your step forward. There should be an imaginary diagonal line from your front foot to your rear foot.You may also prefer to take a step backward to enter the initial staggered stance position, sometimes known as a reverse lunge. All other aspects remain the same.Split lungeThe split lunge, also called the Bulgarian split squat or just split squat in the fitness community, is a more advanced lunge variation in which your rear foot is elevated on a surface such as a chair or bench.Elevating the rear foot shifts more of your weight to your front leg, increasing the demand and stimulus to the muscles on your front leg without adding any external weight.The split lunge also helps prevent injury and improves sports performance to a greater degree than other common leg exercises (4).The split lunge requires good balance and coordination, and you should be comfortable with standard lunges before attempting this exercise.To perform the split lunge:Begin standing lunge-distance in front of a roughly 18-inch (45.7-cm) tall chair seat with your feet hip-width apart.Place one leg behind you on the chair. You can have the balls of your feet and toes on the chair or point your foot, so the top of your foot is in contact with the chair. Try both positions to see which is more comfortable.At the top position, your front shin should have a slight rearward angle.Lower your hips by slowly bringing your back knee toward the ground. Focus on lowering your back knee and hips and avoid driving forward with your front knee.Continue lowering your body until the top of your front thigh is parallel to the ground. At the bottom of the split lunge, your front shin should be perpendicular to the floor or angled forward slightly.Push through your front foot to return to the starting position. Focus your pressure in the rear-third area of your front foot.You can alternate legs each repetition or stay in the staggered stance and perform one side all the way through before switching.The split lunge will take a few workouts to get used to. Depending on the length of your legs, a lower platform may work better. Experiment with different surface heights and foot positions until you find one that works.Jump lungeOnce you’ve developed the strength and coordination for standard and split lunges, you can increase the intensity and explosiveness by adding jump lunges to your training.To perform the jump lunge:Begin standing with your feet hip-width apart.Take a large step forward. The exact distance will depend on your body size but should be roughly 2–3 times the distance of a normal walking step. Your front foot should be pointing directly forward. Your back foot will be turned out very slightly.Lower your hips by slowly bringing your back knee toward the ground. Actively rotate your back foot inward and raise your back heel as you lower your knee for optimal movement. Your front knee will bend as your center of mass lowers.Once your back knee is roughly 6 inches (15.2 cm) off the floor, explosively drive through your front foot and jump off the ground.In midair, switch your feet and land in a lunge position. Your front foot on the previous lunge will now be your rear foot.Use the same lowering portion of the lunge technique to safely absorb your body weight.Continue directly into the next repetition once your rear knee reaches full depth.Landing with proper form is vital to safely absorbing the force and preventing injury. If you find yourself becoming too fatigued to land controllably after each repetition, take a rest before continuing.SummaryLunges are a key exercise to improve your strength and coordination for daily movement tasks. You have options for increasing the difficulty once you can perform standard lunges.Additional leg exercisesThese additional leg exercises do not fit neatly into the standard squat and lunge pattern but are good options for bodyweight leg training.A-skip The A-skip is a classic track-and-field drill that primes your legs for more intense work. For non-track athletes, A-skips are excellent warmup exercises to prepare your body for a leg workout.To perform the A-skip:Stand with your feet hip-width apart.Aggressively raise one knee, keeping the foot on the raised leg flexed.As you raise your knee, push through the floor with your planted foot to lift your heel off the ground.Once your top thigh is parallel to the ground, aggressively drive that foot heel-first to the floor to step forward. Once your heel hits the ground, “paw” the ground by coming up onto your toes and fully pointing your foot, elevating your heel off the ground.As you paw the ground with your planted foot, aggressively raise the other knee to prepare for the next skip.Let your arms swing naturally by having the opposite arm swing upward with the opposing knee.Side lungeThe side lunge is a good exercise to warm up your hips before leg training. Additionally, the side lunge helps stretch out your inner thighs and improves your overall hip mobility.To perform the side lunge:Stand with your feet hip-width apart and take a large lateral step with one leg directly to your side. Your toes should now be on the same line with your feet far apart.Bend your knee on the side you stepped with and sit your hips back to lower your body to the bottom of the lunge. Your other leg should be straight. Put your hands in front of you to balance, and avoid letting your knee shoot past your toes.Push through your heel on the lunging leg to stand up straight and return to the start position.Repeat on the other leg.The side lunge is less suitable for performing as a primary strength exercise and best used as a component of your warmup.Step-upThe step-up is an exercise that requires an elevated surface around 6–12 inches (15–30.5 cm) high. A basic set of stairs will work just fine.Step-ups can be used as both a strength and cardiovascular training exercise. When doing step-ups with bodyweight, they’ll generally fall into the latter category.Nevertheless, incorporating step-ups into your bodyweight strength program will add an extra kick to your workouts and increase the intensity without the need for much equipment.To perform the step-up:Stand with your feet hip-width apart with a 6–12 inch (15–30.5 cm) high stepping surface in front of you.Take a step and place your front foot on the surface.Push through your front foot and fully extend through your knee and ankle to stand up straight on the step.Raise your other knee until your thigh is parallel to the floor. Do not place your back foot on the step.Return your back foot to the original position and step your front foot (the one on the elevated surface) back to the starting position.Alternate sides or repeat on the same side for the target number of repetitions.This step-up variation provides extra work to both legs given that you raise the non-stepping knee up.SummaryAdditional exercises that do not directly fit under the squat and lunge patterns can add variety to your warmup and workout options.Benefits and drawbacks of bodyweight leg trainingThe primary benefit of bodyweight leg training is that you can perform functional and effective movements using minimal equipment.Even practicing the squat and lunge patterns without weights will do wonders for your coordination, strength, mobility, and overall fitness.Furthermore, bodyweight exercises are well suited for circuit training conditioning programs (4).The main downside to bodyweight training is the diminishing strength returns. Although these exercises may be challenging during the early phases of fitness, without adding resistance over time, your body will adapt to the stimulus and not continue to gain strength.Once you can perform 15–20 reps of an exercise, you’re primarily building endurance at that point.While there’s nothing inherently wrong with this, reaping the benefits of long-term strength training will require adding an external load, such as dumbbells, barbells, or kettlebells, to your routine.SummaryBodyweight leg exercises are a great way to begin developing functional strength and always a viable option for conditioning. Eventually, external resistance is needed for continued strength adaptations.The bottom lineBodyweight leg training is a great way to add functional fitness and train vital movement patterns with limited equipment.The squat and lunge patterns are the primary movements available for serious bodyweight leg exercises.Additional movements can be added to your program to increase variety, warm up, and improve mobility.You can manipulate bodyweight exercise routines to focus on different fitness goals, such as strength or conditioning.In the long run, external resistance is needed to continually improve strength. Bodyweight training can always be used as an effective form of cardiovascular conditioning.But best of all, these exercises can be done anywhere, anytime. So next time you need to get your blood flowing after sitting for too long, give some of these exercises a try.",

    "articleTextBody": "Certain exercises can help build strength and improve range of motion after a rotator cuff injury such as a tear or strain. Many of these movements can also help promote healing and prevent complications.As sports fans and athletes alike know, shoulder injuries are serious business. They can be extremely painful, limiting, and slow to heal. Read on to learn about exercises that may help with healing and reduce discomfort.What is a rotator cuff injury?The rotator cuff is a group of four muscles that stabilize the shoulder and allow it to move. Physical therapist and founder of WebPT Heidi Jannenga says you should visualize the head of the arm bone as a golf ball and the area of the shoulder blade as a golf tee. “The rotator cuff serves as a sleeve that enables the ball to spin and roll while remaining on the tee,” she says.The most common rotator cuff injuries are impingements and tears. Impingement: Impingement occurs when a tendon of the rotator cuff becomes compressed in the narrow space between the bone of the upper arm (humerus) and the front of the shoulder blade (acromion). The compression of the tendon can lead to swelling and pain.Tear: A less common injury, a rotator cuff tear (also called strain), occurs when a rotator cuff tendon or muscle is torn. Most tears will not require surgery.Repetitive, overhead motions can wear down the rotator cuff muscles and are thus a common cause of injury. This is why athletes such as baseball pitchers frequently have shoulder issues. A traumatic injury, such as falling onto your arm, can also cause injury. Regardless of how it happens, the risk of a rotator cuff tear increases as we age and the wear on our bodies accumulates. Can the rotator cuff be fixed with exercise?Once the swelling has gone down and your arm is no longer painful to move, certain exercises can help you heal and prevent issues such as a “frozen shoulder” or loss of range of motion. These exercises include:doorway stretchside-lying external rotationhigh-to-low rowsreverse flylawn mower pullAlso, try using the “RICE” method immediately following an injury: Rest, ice, compression, and elevation work together to reduce pain and swelling. If you are comfortable adding weight to these exercises, try using a light dumbbell or resistance band for repetitions. If you do not have a light dumbbell, try using a can of soup.  1. Doorway stretchWarm up your muscles by standing in an open doorway and spreading your arms out to the side.Grip the sides of the doorway with each hand at or below shoulder height, and lean forward through the doorway until you feel a light stretch.Keep a straight back as you lean and shift your weight onto your toes. You should feel a stretch in the front of your shoulder. Do not overstretch.Repeat three times, holding for 15-30 seconds, three times daily. 2. Side-lying external rotationLie down on the side opposite your injured arm.Bend the elbow of your injured arm to 90 degrees and rest the elbow on your side. Your forearm should rest across your abdomen.Hold a light dumbbell in the injured side’s hand and, keeping your elbow against your side, slowly raise the dumbbell toward the ceiling. Stop rotating your arm if you feel the strain.Hold the dumbbell up for a few seconds before returning to the start position with your arm down.Repeat 3 sets of 10 once a day. Increase reps to 15 when a set of 10 becomes easy. 3. High-to-low rowsAttach a resistance band to something sturdy at or above shoulder height. Be sure it is secure so it doesn’t come loose when you pull on it.Get down on one knee so the knee opposite your injured arm is raised. Your body and lowered knee should be aligned. Rest your other hand on your raised knee.Holding the band securely with your arm outstretched, pull your elbow toward your body. Keep your back straight and squeeze your shoulder blades together and down as you pull. Your body should not move or twist with your arm.Return to start and repeat 3 sets of 10. 4. Reverse flyStand with your feet shoulder-width apart and your knees slightly bent. Keep your back straight and bend forward slightly at the waist.With a light weight in each hand, extend your arms and raise them away from your body. Do not lock your elbow. Squeeze your shoulder blades together as you do so. Do not raise your arms above shoulder height.Return to start and repeat 3 sets of 10. 5. Lawnmower pullStand with your feet shoulder-width apart. Place one end of a resistance band under the foot opposite your injured arm. Hold the other end with the injured arm so the band goes diagonally across your body.Keeping your other hand on your hip and without locking your knees, bend slightly at the waist so the hand holding the band is parallel to the opposite knee.As if starting a lawn mower in slow motion, straighten upright while pulling your elbow across the body to your outside ribs. Keep your shoulders relaxed, and squeeze your shoulder blades together as you stand.Repeat 3 sets of 10.Are there more safe exercises for a rotator cuff injury?There are additional exercises you can do to speed up recovery and help prevent additional damage. These include:trapezius and rhomboid self‐myofascial release (SMR)posterior shoulder tennis ball SMRpectoralis major and minor SMR with a tennis ballcross body stretchstatic foam roll chest stretchTakeawayMade up of four muscles, the rotator cuff plays a crucial role in keeping the shoulder stable and mobile. Doing specific exercises and stretches can help you build strength and enhance your range of motion after an injury to the rotator cuff, such as a tear or strain. These exercises can also assist in promoting healing and reducing the chances of any further complications. That said, if you are still experiencing pain, swelling, difficulty raising your arm, or difficulty sleeping on your arm more than a few days after your injury, see your doctor. These are symptoms of a more severe injury.",

    "articleTextBody": "To relieve a pinched nerve in the neck, doing gentle stretches can help. You can also seek advice from a doctor or physical therapist, take pain relieving medications, and try placing hot or cold compress. A pinched nerve is a damaged or compressed nerve. It develops when a nerve root is injured or inflamed. The nerve root is the part where a nerve branches off from the spinal cord.You can get a pinched nerve in different parts of the spine, including your neck, or thoracic or lumbar spine. A pinched nerve in the neck can cause radiculopathy. Symptoms of radiculopathy can include numbness, tingling, weakness, and pain into the arm. Pinched nerves affect about 85 out of every 100,000 adults in the United States each year. In early middle-aged adults, it’s usually caused by a herniated disc. This happens when one of the soft discs in between the vertebrae of your spine slips out and irritates nearby nerves. It may be the result of sudden lifting, twisting, or bending. Pinched nerves are most common in people aged 50 to 54. In middle-aged people and older adults, it’s often caused by age-related degeneration of the spine. Over time, discs can shorten, causing vertebrae to compress and irritate nearby nerves. Bone growths can also compress the nerves.A pinched nerve in the neck may feel like pins and needles. It might also cause pain and weakness in the shoulder, arm, or hand.Severe cases require medical care. But if your symptoms are mild, you can try exercises for a pinched nerve in the neck. Exercises for a trapped nerve in the neckA physical therapist can demonstrate the best pinched nerve stretches for your symptoms. Mild pain, however, may be relieved with gentle exercises. These moves focus on stretching neck muscles and alleviating pressure on the nerve. To prevent further nerve damage, do these exercises slowly. You can perform them while sitting down or standing up. Trap stretchYour trapezius muscles are in the back of your neck. If they’re too tight, they can compress your spine and nerves. This exercise will loosen these muscles and release trapped nerves.Place your right hand under your thigh. With your left hand, gently bend your head to the left side. Pause for 30 seconds. Repeat 3 times on each side. Chin tuckThis move reduces tension in the neck muscles by lengthening your neck. It will also improve posture in the head and neck.Place your fingers on your chin.Gently push your chin toward your neck, until you have a “double chin.” Hold for three to five seconds. Relax.Repeat three to five times. Once you’re comfortable with the move, try chin tucks without using your fingers. Chin tuck with extensionYou can add an extra movement to the chin tuck. It will help stretch your neck in a different direction.For some people, this exercise might cause dizziness. You should avoid it if you have dizziness issues.Pull your head back to do a chin tuck.Slowly tilt your head up to the ceiling. Return to the chin tuck. Relax.Repeat two sets of five reps. Head turnA pinched nerve can decrease your neck’s range of motion, but head turns may help. Perform this exercise in a slow and controlled manner. If you feel pain, try smaller movements.Straighten your head and neck. Look ahead.Slowly turn your head to the right. Pause five to 10 seconds.Slowly turn to the left. Pause five to 10 seconds.You can also tilt your head side to side and up and down. Neck bendIf you have a pinched nerve in the neck, exercises like neck bends will provide relief. You should also do this stretch slowly.Gently move your chin down and toward your chest. Pause. Return to starting position.Repeat 5 to 10 times.Shoulder rollShoulder rolls release tension in both the shoulders and neck. This can help relieve pressure and pain from a pinched nerve.Lift your shoulder blades up, and then roll them back and down.Repeat five to six times.Repeat in the opposite direction.Other pinched nerve treatmentsIn addition to stretches, you can try other treatments for pinched nerves. These methods will decompress nerves, loosen tight muscles, and reduce pain. If you have mild symptoms, you might find relief from:restsoft cervical collarhot or cold compresspracticing good posturenonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)acupuncturemassageyogaMore painful cases need medical attention.Pinched nerve symptomsPinched nerve symptoms may range from mild to severe. It’s also possible to have a pinched nerve without any symptoms.Common symptoms include:pins and needlesmuscle weaknessburning sensationnumbnesspain that radiates outwardpain when moving your neck or head poor neck range of motionWhen to see a doctorPinched nerves can resolve on their own. This might take days, weeks, or months.Visit a doctor if your symptoms don’t go away with home treatments. You should also seek medical help if your symptoms are severe or get worse.A doctor can refer you to a physical therapist. Depending on your symptoms, they might also suggest oral corticosteroids, steroid injections, or surgery. TakeawayIf you have a pinched nerve in the neck, these exercises can provide relief. They will help decompress the nerve and loosen tight muscles.Do these stretches gently and carefully. If you feel pain or discomfort, don’t force it. A physical therapist can show you the best moves for your symptoms.You can also try other pinched nerve treatments like NSAIDs and hot or cold compress. If your symptoms are severe or don’t go away, seek medical attention.",

    "articleTextBody": "If you experience bladder leakage, some therapies and exercises, such as Kegel exercises and bladder training, could help improve your bladder control.An overactive bladder (OAB) is a condition in which your bladder leaks or squeezes urine out without you trying to urinate. OAB can be inconvenient and uncomfortable, and it could lead to episodes of incontinence and feelings of embarrassment.Keep reading to learn more about 5 exercises and treatments to help manage OAB.1. Kegel exercisesKegel exercises can help strengthen your pelvic floor muscles and improve bladder control, according to the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK).The pelvic floor muscles help control your bladder, rectum, and uterus. They lie between the front and back of your pelvis. To perform Kegel exercises, squeeze the muscles of your pelvic floor. If you’re unsure how to isolate these muscles, try to stop urinating midstream. The muscles you use to cut off urine are the same ones you should tighten during Kegel exercises.The NIDDK recommends holding each “squeeze” for 3 seconds. Gradually build up to 3 sets of 10 repetitions every day. Just make sure to stop if you’re experiencing any pain.Learn more about specific kegel exercises for overactive bladder.2. BiofeedbackA technique called biofeedback may help you do Kegel exercises more effectively. In biofeedback, a doctor inserts a probe into the vagina to help monitor your pelvic muscle activity. The doctor uses computer graphs and audio cues to identify which muscles you’re contracting during Kegel exercises.If you’re contracting the wrong muscles, the doctor will help you find and engage the right ones for better results.It’s important to note that research on biofeedback for OAB is mixed. A 2022 review found that biofeedback did not provide more benefits for OAB than Kegel exercises alone. As such, it’s best to work with a doctor to determine the best treatment for you. 3. Bladder trainingBladder training may help improve OAB symptoms by training your bladder to hold more urine, which can help you wait longer between bathroom visits.First, use a diary to determine the average frequency and volume of your urine output and hydration habits. After identifying this baseline, use the following tips to train your bladder to hold more urine:Urinate as soon as you wake up and again after breakfast, then urinate at intervals throughout the day.Drink water at intervals throughout the day, such as one to two glasses at each meal.If you experience the urge to urinate, try waiting a few minutes to let it pass. To help distract yourself, try breathing techniques or sitting in a chair and leaning forward.Gradually increase the time between your bathroom intervals throughout the day. After several weeks of practice, you should be able to extend the time between your bathroom visits.Learn more about overactive bladder training.4. Electrical stimulationElectrical stimulation may also help you gain control of your bladder.In this treatment, a temporary wire or implanted electrode delivers electrical impulses to your bladder. These signals cause your bladder muscles to contract, which can help strengthen the muscles over time.The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved two types of electrical stimulation for treating OAB: percutaneous tibial nerve stimulation (PTNS)sacral neuromodulation (SNS)Learn more about electrical stimulation for an overactive bladder.5. Vaginal conesYou can use vaginal cones or weights as a vaginal weight-training tool for your pelvic floor muscles. This can be useful if you don’t have as much time to invest in biofeedback or electrical stimulation.Here’s how to use vaginal cones:Place a cone inside your vagina. Use your pelvic floor muscles to lift it. After you can hold lighter cones without discomfort, train your muscles to lift heavier cones. Your pelvic floor muscles will strengthen throughout this process.What are other ways to treat an overactive bladder?Treatment for OAB will depend on several factors, such as the severity of your incontinence. Your treatment plan may include a combination of:natural remedies, such as exercising, avoiding constipation, and avoiding certain foods and beveragesmedications, such as anticholinergics, beta-3 agonists, and tricyclic antidepressantsmedical devices, such as a catheter or pessarysurgery, such as sling surgery, artificial urinary sphincter, or bladder enlargementA healthcare professional could help develop the best treatment plan for you. What vitamins help with bladder control?Some supplements and herbs may help relieve OAB, including:gosha-jinki-gan (GJG)Ganoderma lucidum (GL)corn silk (Zea mays)capsaicinpumpkin seedskohki teamagnesium hydroxide L-arginineHowever, it’s important to note the research supporting these remedies is limited. As such, it’s best to work with a doctor to develop the best treatment plan.When to see a doctor?According to the NIDDK, you may have OAB if you’re:urinating more than eight times per day or more than twice per nighthaving sudden, strong urges to urinateleaking urine after such an urgeIf you experience these urinary habits, speak with a healthcare professional. You should also see a doctor if your bathroom routine is unusual or disruptive.\n{\n  \"@context\": \"https://schema.org\",\n  \"@type\": \"FAQPage\",\n  \"mainEntity\": [{\n    \"@type\": \"Question\",\n    \"name\": \"What exercise is good for overactive bladder?\",\n    \"acceptedAnswer\": {\n      \"@type\": \"Answer\",\n      \"text\": \"Exercises that could help overactive bladder include Kegel exercises, which involve squeezing the muscles of your pelvic floor muscles.\"\n    }\n  },{\n    \"@type\": \"Question\",\n    \"name\": \"Do squats help with overactive bladder?\",\n    \"acceptedAnswer\": {\n      \"@type\": \"Answer\",\n      \"text\": \"Squats may help strengthen the muscles around your pelvis, such as the glutes.

    "articleTextBody": "Studio Marmellata/Stocksy UnitedThoracic outlet syndrome involves a group of disorders that leads to compression at the thoracic outlet. The thoracic outlet is the space between the clavicle (collarbone) and first rib. Within this region are nerves and blood vessels that supply the shoulder and arm, such as the brachial plexus, subclavian artery, and subclavian vein.Often, thoracic outlet syndrome can result in pain, numbness, and weakness of the muscles in the upper extremities. The type and severity of symptoms will depend on the cause of thoracic outlet syndrome and whether nerves, blood vessels, or both are compressed.Fortunately, thoracic outlet syndrome can usually be treated with physical therapy and pain management. Rarely, surgical intervention may be required.This article explains what thoracic outlet syndrome is, causes and treatments, and helpful exercises and stretches for you to try.What is thoracic outlet syndrome?Thoracic outlet syndrome is a group of conditions that occur when the nerves and/or blood vessels of the thoracic outlet are compressed.Compression of the thoracic outlet can lead to symptoms such as pain, weakness, numbness/tingling, discoloration, swelling, muscle wasting, protruding veins, cold hands, and in severe cases, an aneurysm or embolism.Rest assured, severe cases account for only 1%–2% of thoracic outlet cases.There are three main types of thoracic outlet syndrome, and symptoms may vary depending on what is most affected. The three main types of thoracic outlet syndrome include:Neurogenic thoracic outlet syndrome: This is the most common form of thoracic outlet syndrome, accounting for around 95% of cases. It occurs when the nerves in the thoracic outlet (i.e., brachial plexus nerves) are compressed.Venous thoracic outlet syndrome: This type of thoracic outlet syndrome happens when one or more veins (i.e., subclavian vein, axillary vein) under the collarbone are compressed. This accounts for around 3%–5% of cases.Arterial thoracic outlet syndrome: The rarest and most dangerous form, arterial thoracic outlet syndrome occurs when the arteries (i.e., subclavian artery, axillary artery) under the collarbone are compressed, often resulting in an aneurysm. Only around 1%–2% of cases are arterial thoracic outlet syndrome.Compression of the thoracic outlet can lead to symptoms such as pain, weakness, numbness/tingling, discoloration, swelling, muscle wasting, protruding veins, cold hands, and in severe cases, an aneurysm or embolism.Exercises for thoracic outlet syndromeBefore starting any exercise program, it’s important to get clearance by a healthcare professional first. Working with a physical therapist can help guide you through your diagnosis and give personalized exercise programs based on your condition.In particular, physical therapy is often advised for people with neurogenic thoracic outlet syndrome but may not be appropriate for those with venous or arterial thoracic outlet syndrome, since surgery is often required. If conservative measures don’t help, it’s best to follow up with a physician.The following exercises can help you with your rehabilitation, but should only be performed once you and a healthcare professional feel you’re ready. The goal is to strengthen the upper back and shoulder muscles, as well as your postural stabilizers. Retraining your posture often can also help improve symptoms.Standing rowsWrap a resistance band around a stable post. Alternatively, wrap the band around a doorknob and close the door so it’s stable.Grab the resistance band with both hands and stand straight.With elbows bent, gently pull the resistance band back until your elbows are just past the sides of your body. Use your scapula (shoulder blades) to pull the bands back, rather than your arms.Then, gently return the bands back to starting position.Perform 2–3 sets of 8–12 reps.Note: Be sure to slide your shoulder blades down and back, squeezing them gently together in the back.Quadruped thread the needleStart on all fours, with your palms flat on the floor and your spine in a neutral position. Make sure your knees and hips are stacked and your shoulders and hands are aligned. Lift your right hand then gently thread it beneath your left arm, allowing your right hand to graze the floor.Allow your chest and right shoulder to lower towards the ground.Next, slowly bring your right arm back and then reach out toward the ceiling, allowing your chest to rotate outward to the right.Then, bring your right arm back down and repeat the sequence.Continue this for 8–12 reps. Then, switch sides.Prone snow angelLie on your stomach with your forehead touching the ground, legs straight, arms at your side (palms facing down).Gently lift your arms a few inches off ground by retracting shoulder blades. This is the starting position.Next, slowly bring your arms out to the sides (perpendicular to your body). If this is comfortable, continue to bring your arms until they’re over your head. Then, slowly return arms to the starting position. As you’ll notice, the movement is similar to doing snow angels.Perform 8–12 reps, or as many as you feel comfortable doing.Note: If you find it too difficult to move your arms toward your head, you can perform this exercise by lifting your arms by your sides and holding this position. This exercise is fairly advanced and should be attempted later in the recovery process.Resistance band pull-apart Stand up straight with your elbows bent around 90 degrees. Hold a resistance band taut in front of you with both hands (palms facing up). The band should be parallel to the floor.Keeping elbows bent at sides, slowly pull the band toward your abdomen by moving your arms out to the sides. Focus on squeezing your shoulder blades together to initiate the movement and keep your spine neutral.Slowly return to the starting position and repeat.Perform 1–3 sets of 8–12 reps.Stretches to help with thoracic outlet syndromeStretching can play a helpful role in your recovery of neurogenic thoracic outlet syndrome. In particular, it’s important to stretch the scalene muscles (large muscles near the front sides of your neck) and pectoral muscles (chest muscles).Scalene stretchSit upright in a chair with your feet flat on the floor.Take your right hand and grab the seat of the chair.Next, tilt your head to the left while keeping your head straight. You should feel a stretch in the right side of your neck. If it’s painful, lighten the stretch or stop.Hold this for 30–60 seconds. Then, switch sides.Pectoralis stretchStand at the opening of a door with both hands on each side of the doorframe. Your hands should be slightly above shoulder height.Next, allow your body to lean forward to stretch your chest. For added support, place one foot forward and slightly bend your knee.Hold this position for 20–30 seconds.Note: If this stretch further exacerbates the symptoms of numbness and tingling in your fingers, discontinue the stretch, or modify it so you do only one arm at a time.Sitting back extensionSit upright in a chair with your hands on the back of your head and elbows out to the side.Gently lean back until you feel a stretch in your chest.Hold this for 30 seconds.Exercises to avoid with thoracic outlet syndromeWhile no exercises are officially off-limits, you may need to limit certain movements during recovery from neurogenic thoracic outlet syndrome. If you have arterial or venous thoracic outlet syndrome, it’s crucial to consult with a healthcare professional first.It’s often recommended you limit or avoid overhead movements or exercises that require lifting heavy loads (e.g., dumbbells, barbells, etc.) until you’ve received clearance from your physical therapist or healthcare team.Often, it may also be a good idea to steer clear of chest exercises (e.g., bench press) until you’re further along in your recovery. Recovering from thoracic outlet syndrome requires focusing on strengthening the back muscles more than the front.During recovery, it’s important to take it slow and avoid overdoing it, which can exacerbate your condition. Listen to your body and only perform movements that feel comfortable and are not painful. Causes of thoracic outlet syndromeThere are many causes of thoracic outlet syndrome, such as:Anatomical defects: People born with an extra cervical rib or those who have an abnormal formation of the first rib, collarbone, or scalene muscle are at an increased risk for thoracic outlet syndrome due to less available space and greater risk of compression in this area.Injury/trauma: Whiplash, overuse injuries, repeated overhead motions (e.g., jobs that require working with hands above head), athletic injuries, and other injuries to the upper extremities can increase risk.Rounded posture: Forward head positioning, text neck, and the rounded or hunched shoulders that often result from too much screen time can also lead to thoracic outlet syndrome.Cancer: Though rare, growth of a tumor in the neck can lead to compression of the thoracic outlet.Other: Some other factors, such as overdeveloped muscles (e.g., bodybuilding), weight gain, and poor posture can put additional stress on the nerves and vessels of the thoracic outlet.How is thoracic outlet syndrome treated?Treatment for thoracic outlet syndrome depends on the type and severity of the condition, which is why it is crucial to get a proper diagnosis from a qualified healthcare professional.Once you have received your diagnosis, your healthcare team may recommend physical therapy as a first step of treatment, especially in those with neurogenic thoracic outlet syndrome. Pain medications or injections may also be used for pain management.If symptoms do not improve with physical therapy and pain management, then surgery may be required.Usually, those with venous or arterial thoracic outlet syndrome will require surgery and may also be prescribed anticoagulants.Why is posture important for thoracic outlet syndrome?Maintaining good posture can help reduce pressure on nerves and vessels within the thoracic outlet.Common signs of poor posture include rounding the shoulders and upper back and pushing the head and neck forward. Over time, these postures can result in tightness and pressure within the thoracic outlet.When done often, some activities can worsen posture, such as working at a computer, playing a musical instrument that requires bending forward (e.g., string instruments), holding heavy bags or a child, or other activities that bring the shoulders and neck forward.To avoid this, it’s important to maintain good posture and keep the thoracic outlet “open”. This can be done by holding the shoulders up and back, keeping the neck in a neutral position, and holding your head up (chin parallel to the ground).Performing exercises that strengthen the upper back and neck extensors can also help support better posture.Frequently asked questions about thoracic outlet syndromeWhat aggravates thoracic outlet syndrome?Repetitive overhead movements, poor posture, and heavy lifting can worsen thoracic outlet syndrome.Is massage good for thoracic outlet syndrome?For some people, massage may help to relieve symptoms of thoracic outlet syndrome and help open up the space in that region. However, it’s best to see a trained professional to avoid worsening the injury.How do you calm thoracic outlet syndrome?For many, limiting activities that worsen thoracic outlet syndrome (e.g., overhead movement or heavy lifting) can help reduce pain. Also, working with a physical therapist can help ensure a safe recovery.Is heat or cold good for thoracic outlet syndrome?Applying heat to your shoulder and neck can help improve blood circulation, thereby reducing some pain and discomfort in people with neurogenic thoracic outlet syndrome.What happens if thoracic outlet syndrome is left untreated?Early treatment is important for relieving symptoms of thoracic outlet syndrome. If left untreated, you may experience increased pain and discomfort. If you have venous or arterial thoracic outlet syndrome, it’s important to seek medical attention as this can potentially lead to serious issues, such as blood clots.\n{\n  \"@context\": \"https://schema.org\",\n  \"@type\": \"FAQPage\",\n  \"mainEntity\": [{\n    \"@type\": \"Question\",\n    \"name\": \"What aggravates thoracic outlet syndrome?\",\n    \"acceptedAnswer\": {\n      \"@type\": \"Answer\",\n      \"text\": \"Repetitive overhead movements, poor posture, and heavy lifting can worsen thoracic outlet syndrome.\"\n    }\n  },{\n    \"@type\": \"Question\",\n    \"name\": \"Is massage good for thoracic outlet syndrome?\",\n    \"acceptedAnswer\": {\n      \"@type\": \"Answer\",\n      \"text\": \"For some people, massage may help to relieve symptoms of thoracic outlet syndrome and help open up the space in that region.

    "articleTextBody": "Medications and steroid injections are first-line treatments for occipital neuralgia. Exercises you can do at home or with a physical therapist may complement them.Occipital neuralgia causes intense pain that most often starts within the base of your head and continues up toward your scalp. It follows along the occipital nerves, which can cause symptoms to affect one side of your head at a time, sometimes both sides.When you have shooting, aching, and throbbing pain and headaches from occipital neuralgia, one of the last things you may want to do is physical activity. However, certain stretches and exercises may help complement medical treatments and prevent future pain.The selection of exercises largely depends on the underlying cause of occipital neuralgia, such as an injury or pinched nerves, so it’s important to speak with a doctor or physical therapist to learn which exercises are best for you.Occipital neuralgia exercisesBelow are some occipital neuralgia exercises to consider discussing with a doctor or physical therapist.Neck stretchesTight neck muscles are common triggers of occipital neuralgia pain. This is where a neck stretch might help.In a seated position, try the following gentle neck stretches:Turn your head to the left and hold for 5–10 seconds. Repeat on the right side. You can repeat this up to 10 times.Tilt your head toward your left shoulder and hold for 5 seconds before repeating on your right side. Repeat up to 10 times.Tilt your head forward toward your chest and hold for up to 10 seconds. Repeat up to 10 times.Tilt your head backward until you feel a gentle stretch. Hold for 5 seconds and repeat 5 times.Chin tucksA chin tuck is another method that can help relax tight neck muscles.When sitting or standing, tuck your chin toward your chest without looking down. Hold for up to 10 seconds. Repeat 5–10 times.Shoulder liftsShoulder lifts may also help with neck muscle tightness. To do them: Roll your shoulders back and keep your neck long.Gently shrug your shoulders up toward your head and then relax. Repeat up to 5 times.Breathing exercisesBreathing exercises can help reduce various types of chronic pain by decreasing activity within the sympathetic nervous system, which is responsible for responding to pain and stress. With regular practice, proponents say it’s possible to experience better pain responses.While specific research on breathing exercises for occipital neuralgia is lacking, it’s possible it may help migraine and other headache disorders. For this reason, the American Migraine Foundation recommends regular breathing exercises to help prevent migraine pain.One technique is called diaphragmatic breathing. To do this:Place one hand on the middle of your upper chest.Place your other hand on your stomach, just beneath your rib cage but above the diaphragm.To inhale, slowly breathe in through your nose, drawing your breath down toward the stomach. Your stomach should push upward against your hand while your chest remains still.To exhale, tighten your abdominal muscles and let your stomach fall downward while exhaling through pursed lips. Your chest should remain still.Repeat for up to 20 minutes several times per week.Another technique is called square breathing. It involves the following process that you can repeat as many times as you’d like:Inhale for 4 seconds through your nose.Hold your breath for 4 seconds.Exhale through your mouth for 4 seconds.Wait 4 seconds before inhaling again.Exercises to avoid with occipital neuralgiaIf you’re experiencing acute occipital neuralgia pain, you may consider avoiding any exercises that require you to lie flat on your back. This position may press against the associated nerves.Also, if you try any of the above exercises and experience worsening pain, stop right away and let your doctor know.Why physical therapy may be effective for occipital neuralgiaAs a primary headache disorder, occipital neuralgia symptoms may also improve with the help of physical therapy. This is especially the case with a technique called manual (manipulative) therapy, a common hands-on approach.While specific clinical studies on manual therapy for occipital neuralgia are lacking, researchers do believe this physical therapy technique may be helpful for numerous types of primary headache disorders. As one 2022 review points out, the therapy may help:reduce muscle activitydecrease the number of headachesalleviate headache intensityIf you’re interested in physical therapy as part of your occipital neuralgia treatment, speak with your insurance provider, as you may need a doctor’s referral. You might benefit from in-clinic manual therapies. A physical therapist can also teach you exercises to try at home.When to contact a doctor about occipital neuralgiaConsider speaking with a doctor before trying exercises for occipital neuralgia, especially if you’re recovering from an injury or infection.Also contact a doctor if your current treatment plan isn’t improving your symptoms, or your symptoms interfere with everyday activities, such as work and sleep.If you do not yet have a formal diagnosis of occipital neuralgia, reach out to a doctor about testing. The symptoms can be similar to those of other conditions, such as migraine.Traditional treatments for occipital neuralgiaExercises may help alleviate occipital neuralgia symptoms, but they shouldn’t be used in place of medical treatments a doctor might prescribe.Traditional treatments for occipital neuralgia include a combination of:nerve block injections, which may both diagnose and treat the conditionsteroid injections to reduce inflammationover-the-counter or prescription pain medications, particularly nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)anticonvulsantstricyclic antidepressantsserotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs)botulinum toxin A injectionstopical anestheticsheat therapysurgeryFrequently asked questions about exercises for occipital neuralgiaSince most of the available clinical research on occipital neuralgia focuses on medications and surgeries, it’s important to ask a doctor before trying exercises and home remedies.\n{\n  \"@context\": \"https://schema.org\",\n  \"@type\": \"FAQPage\",\n  \"mainEntity\": [{\n    \"@type\": \"Question\",\n    \"name\": \"What is the best exercise for occipital neuralgia?\",\n    \"acceptedAnswer\": {\n      \"@type\": \"Answer\",\n      \"text\": \"Neck stretches are among the best exercises for occipital neuralgia.

Since the causes of occipital neuralgia vary, it’s important to have an accurate diagnosis before attempting any stretches or other exercises on your own. Consider discussing this further with a doctor.",

    "articleTextBody": "The trapezius muscle starts right below the skull, runs down the neck and across the shoulders, and then continues down the spine in a “V” shape. It works to stabilize your shoulders and upper back. Have you ever wondered why bodybuilders tend to have such curved, sculpted necks? It’s because they’ve heavily worked their trapezius, a large, stingray-shaped muscle. Bodybuilding may not be for you, but to maintain good posture and avoid back pain, it’s important to keep the trapezius strong.We spoke to two experts to learn some easy ways to work your trapezius, whether you’re a regular at the gym or prefer to work out in your living room.Dr. Matthew Gammons is a primary care sports medicine physician at Vermont Orthopedic Clinic and second vice president of the American Society for Sports Medicine. Mark Kovacs, CTPS, MTPS is a performance physiologist, sports and exercise science researcher, and executive director of the International Tennis Performance Association. Here are four exercises they recommend to keep your trapezius strong. 1. Shoulder blade squeeze“Unless you’re a bodybuilder trying to get a large trapezius, you need exercises to help the trapezius do its job well, stabilizing the shoulder and upper back,” Gammons says. The shoulder blade squeeze is an easy way to do that.Stand with good posture.Slowly squeeze the shoulder blades together and hold for 3 seconds.Slowly release the shoulder blades back to their relaxed positions.This exercise can also be done using cables, a resistance band, or holding your arms out front in a goal post position. 2. ShrugSimple shrugs are another away to keep your trapezius strong. “The shrug is very common and easy to implement, and it’s one of the best exercises to activate the trapezius,” Kovacs says. For an added challenge, do this exercise with weights in your hands.Stand up with good posture.Raise your shoulders as high as you can get them, as if attempting to touch your ears with your shoulders.Hold for a count of two.Release them back into their relaxed positions.Repeat 20 times. 3. Upright rowThis is a popular exercise for strengthening the trapezius. You can also try this with dumbbells or a barbell in your hands.Stand up straight.With your fists clenched, pull up your fists as high as you can while bending your elbows, keeping your hands close to the front of your body.Hold for a count of two.Release your arms back into a relaxed position, fists still clenched.Repeat 20 times. 4. PushupThere are a few different variations of the pushup. Do the version that’s easiest for you: A standard pushup, a pushup while kneeling on the floor, or a standing pushup against a wall.Put your hands flat on the floor or the wall.Lower your body toward your hands while keeping your back straight and your stomach tight. Do not let your head drop; keep your neck in line with the rest of your spine.Lower your body until you’re close to the floor or the wall, and then push back into an upright position. Inhale as you go down and exhale as you push up.The key with the pushup is to “really concentrate on pushing the shoulders together” during the exercise, Gammons says. “Make your middle and lower trapezius work to do the job.” Is it possible to injure my trapezius?Tearing or straining the trapezius doesn’t happen very often, Kovacs says. It usually only happens to bodybuilders who attempt to work the trapezius with too much weight.“Another type of injury would be when you’re forcing resistance in one direction and you move very quickly in the opposite direction, such as with the frictional forces that occasionally happen in an acute, violent crash,” he adds. This can happen in an automobile accident or to linemen who collide when playing football.Gammons notes that, as with any exercise, you should start gently when working your trapezius. Don’t overdo it. Bottom lineA healthy trapezius is not just for the fittest of the fit. Pregnant women often struggle with a changing center of gravity that pulls them forward, so they need a strong trapezius to help balance them back. Older adults can also benefit from having a strong trapezius muscle to help with any balancing challenges.“When most people think of the trapezius, they think of a bodybuilder’s mature neck muscle,” Kovacs says. “But it does much more than control neck movement. The muscle is very important when picking something up off the ground or lifting anything.”Remember: When performing any exercise, be certain to use proper form. If you’re uncertain, please consult a personal trainer or other fitness professional.",

    "articleTextBody": "Exercising with knee osteoarthritis is possible and can reduce pain. However, it’s best to keep it low-impact and stop if there’s worsening pain, swelling, or other symptoms.If you have osteoarthritis of the knees, exercise should and can still be a part of your lifestyle. The key is to know the right exercises and the right way to do them.Generally, long-term exercise is safe for adults with knee pain. Moreover, when performed correctly, the right exercise can even decrease the pain of arthritis. This can improve your ability to carry out ordinary physical activities.It may seem counterintuitive for exercise to decrease knee pain, so it’s helpful to understand how it works.Exercise improves:hormonal balance lowers blood sugar improves articular cartilage tolerance strengthens musclesExercise also improves your muscle strength. Stronger muscles are able to carry your body weight more efficiently, relieving some of the burden put on the joints.However, performing the “wrong” exercise or using poor form may increase pain or inflict irritation to the joint. “Pain isn’t normal,” warns Alice Bell, a doctor of physical therapy and board certified specialist in geriatrics.That said, it’s important to note that when starting a new exercise program, you may experience “muscular soreness,” which is different from joint pain. It’s normal to experience muscle soreness for 24–48 hours after exercises, and this is when you should take a rest day.A smart exercise routine can be easy to master, and broad guidelines can be helpful. However, the safest and most effective way to launch into an exercise routine is with a licensed professional, such as a physical therapist, guiding the process. An expert will analyze your form and make suggestions.How to practice squattingSquatting can help build leg and hip strength, leading to more stable joints. Over time, your range of motion will increase. As long as you’re able to practice with minimal knee joint discomfort, it’s safe to include squats in your exercise routine.People with arthritis may find the most benefit in wall squats, since squatting against the wall can help reduce your risk of putting unnecessary or incorrect pressure on your knees.To do a basic squat:Stand with your back against a wall. Your feet should be shoulder-width apart, with your heels about 18 inches away from wall.Keep your knees in line with your heels, not out in front of your toes.Breathe in and exhale as you sit down or “squat.” Your buttocks shouldn’t drop any lower than knee level.Keep your abdominal muscles tight and ensure that your back is pressed flat against the wall.Push up through your heels — not the balls of your feet — and inhale as you stand up.“Keep the knee over the ankle and not over the ball of the foot,” Bell cautions.“If you begin to experience intense pain at any point — more than your typical knee pain — you should stop the practice for the day. “Be sure to give the move another try during your next practice. You’ll find that your pain threshold increases as you build up muscle strength.”How to practice deep lungingFor people with knee osteoarthritis, lunging poses the same benefits and risks as deep squatting. Lunges are a great way to improve your overall leg and hip strength, but they may cause unnecessary pain when practiced incorrectly.The trick, Bell says, is to make sure your knee doesn’t extend past your ankle.You may also find it helpful to practice lunges while holding on to the back of a chair or table for added support.To do a basic lunge:Grab on to your support, if needed.Step forward with one leg. Be sure to keep your forward knee above your ankle. Your knee should never extend past your ankle.Once you’re stable in position, slowly lift your back heel off of the floor.Keep lifting until you form a straight line from your back knee to your hip.Engage, or tighten, your abdominal muscles. This will help keep your back straight as you move into a lunging position. Slouching or leaning forward will put unnecessary stress on your front knee.During your practice, it’s important that you take note of any changes in pain or discomfort. If you begin experiencing more pain than usual, you should stop lunging for the day and move on to another form of exercise.How to runRunning can increase your overall wellness and help control weight. This can reduce the amount of stress on your knees and lessen the overall effect of osteoarthritis.However, some caveats do apply:Choose sturdy, supportive shoes. “Footwear is underrated when it comes to protecting your joints,” Bell says.Run on dirt, grass, gravel, or asphalt, if available. They’re softer than concrete.Pay attention to any pain. If you begin experiencing more pain than usual, take a break for a day or two. If the pain continues, see your doctor. An unusual pain may be the result of something other than arthritis.Although people with knee osteoarthritis can run safely, Bell advises leaving this sport to those who have been running for a while. She’s assessing that long-time runners have developed proper running form and have developed muscle support around the joint.“No one with arthritis should start running,” she says flatly.If running hasn’t been a part of your exercise routine and you find that you’d like to start, talk with your doctor. They can discuss your individual benefits and risks and provide guidance on next steps.How to practice high-impact sports and repetitive jumpingThere does seem to be a link between joint injury from high-impact sports and the risk of osteoarthritis. However, to be clear, the injury contributes to the risk and not the high-impact activity itself.That doesn’t mean that you have to give up high-impact workouts, though. The key is to practice thoughtfully and in moderation.To minimize symptoms:Don’t engage in high-impact sports or other activities that involve repetitive jumping every day. A general rule of thumb is to take a 2- or 3-day break in between high-impact sports. Your practice should only run for an hour tops.Consider wearing a knee brace during practice. This can help keep your knee in proper position, particularly if the arthritis has compromised the alignment.If you’re experiencing mild pain or swelling, take a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, such as naproxen (Aleve), after practice, if cleared by your doctor.If you haven’t engaged in high-impact activities before, talk to your physical therapist before starting now. They can walk you through the potential effect these activities will have on your affected knee.Bell is likely to advise her clients with arthritis to avoid high-impact activity altogether. She notes that jumping up and down creates an effect on your joints equal to about 7-10 times your body weight.How to practice walking or running up stairsAlthough walking up and down stairs may hurt, it can be a good strengthening exercise for your leg and hip muscles.There’s another benefit to exercise, and that’s having a protective effect on joint or articular cartilage. This is extremely important for slowing the onset of osteoarthritis.Think of articular cartilage as a protective covering for your joints. Articular cartilage functions as a shock absorber and also reduces friction between bones where they meet at joints. As a person ages, this cartilage can wear away, leading to joint pain and swelling, or osteoarthritis.Research shows that loading of the articular cartilage maintains the health of the cartilage and that avoidance of loading, aka exercise, results in atrophy, or thinning of the articular cartilage.To safely climb steps: Take your time. A slow and steady approach can help you maintain your stability.Use the railing for support. If you currently use a cane, talk to your physical therapist about how to best use it while on stairs.For a low-impact alternative, try using a stair stepper machine. When using a stair stepper, keep the following in mind:Start with a shorter workout and increase the duration over time. Doing too much too quickly can be harmful.Adjust the height of the rise to suit your needs. Bell advises that you start small and gradually work your way up to a higher step.Use the railing for support, as needed. Be careful not to lean on the rails.Are certain exercises easier on the knees?Water aerobics are often suggested when recuperating from sore joints. Although the water can have a soothing, buoyant effect on your knees, Bell says it’s unlikely to produce enough resistance to strengthen the surrounding muscles.“If you really want to create enough resistance to make a difference, land-based exercises ultimately are what you need,” she says.Some of her favorites include cycling, at moderate or high intensity, and strengthening exercises like Pilates.You may be able to get more out of a low-impact workout by incorporating weighted elastic bands or free weights into your routine.You may also find it beneficial to wear a knee brace while exercising. If you haven’t already, talk with your doctor about whether this is a good option for you. They can make specific recommendations and advise you on best practices.How to make the most of your workoutYou’ll likely experience mild soreness when exercising, especially if you haven’t exercised for a while.When planning your routine, be sure to keep the level of intensity reasonable.Your doctor or physical therapist can provide a personalized recommendation suited to your needs. The “dose” of exercise should be enough to produce a difference, but not so much that you become injured or discouraged.Other tipsInvest in sneakers that are comfortable and provide proper support.Always warm up before exercising. Stretching can help open up your joints and reduce the level of impact on your knees.If your joints are already sore, apply heat before exercising to reduce potential stiffness.Start with a 10-minute routine and increase the duration over time.Break up high-impact exercise with low-impact modifications or alternatives.Cool down after exercising. Take a few minutes to stretch out your joints. Applying a cold compress can also help reduce pain and swelling.When to avoid exercise altogether if you have osteoarthritis in your kneeIf you experience any of the following symptoms, stop exercising until you can see your doctor:increased swellingsharp, stabbing, or constant painpain that causes you to limp or change your gaitjoints that feel warm to the touch or are redpain that lasts more than 2 hours after exercise or worsens at nightIf the pain persists, resist the temptation to mask it with pain medication, Bell says. You want to find out the underlying cause of the problem and fix it.She also advises people with knee osteoarthritis to resist the urge to back off exercise altogether. After consulting your doctor, you should get moving again with an exercise regimen that’s tailored for you.The bottom lineNot only is exercising with knee osteoarthritis possible, but it’s also necessary to check or even reverse the pain associated with the condition.Bell notes that most states allow you to see a physical therapist without a referral and that one or two sessions can result in an exercise prescription personalized for your goals and abilities.“The worst thing you can do is nothing,” Bell says, adding that it’s best to optimize your workout before arthritis pain begins to slow you down. Using precautions while practicing can help you carry on with your preferred exercise routine for longer.",

You can do these lying down, sitting, standing, or kneeling. A tight lower back may affect your daily movements and impact your quality of life. Sometimes, lower back tightness is also accompanied by symptoms like pain, spasms, and cramping that could affect your pelvis, hips, and legs.Stretches and exercises can help improve flexibility and strength in your lower back. They can also lengthen and extend your spine, helping to relieve compression in the lower back. Here are nine exercises you can add to your daily routine.1. Hip circlesThis exercise increases flexibility, relieves tension, and helps loosen the lower back and hip muscles. If comfortable, you can also engage your core muscles.Muscles used:rectus abdominis (abdominal muscles)erector spinae (muscles that run the length of the back)pelvic musclesgluteal musclesStand with your feet slightly wider than your hips and your hands on your hips.Start by gently moving your hips from side to side.Slowly rotate your hips in one direction, making big circles.Do at least 10 circles.Repeat in the opposite direction.2. Windshield wipersThis exercise helps relieve tension and tightness in the lower back and stretches your hips.Muscles used:erector spinaesacral muscles (muscles of the part of the spinal column connected to the pelvis)pelvic muscles obliquesLie on your back, bend your knees, and extend your arms out to the side so they’re perpendicular to your torso. Your feet can be a little wider than your hips.Exhale as you slowly drop your knees down to the right and turn to look to the left.Inhale, returning to the starting position.Continue this movement for 1 minute, alternating between the left and right sides.3. Knees to chestThis stretch helps loosen lower back muscles and increase flexibility while stretching and stabilizing the pelvis.Muscles used:gluteus maximuspelvic musclesspinal extensorsquadricepsLie on your back with both legs extended.Draw your right knee to your chest with your fingers interlaced around your shin.Hold this position for 5 seconds, then release your leg.Repeat this stretch 5 times on both legs.Draw both knees into your chest and hold your hands, arms, or elbows.Hold this position for 30 seconds.4. Reclining single-leg stretchThis stretch relaxes the lower back and stretches the hamstrings. It also helps to align the spine.Muscles used:hamstringsgluteus maximusrectus abdominiserector spinaeLie on your back with both legs extended.Lift your right leg up so it’s as straight as possible, keeping a slight bend in the knee. You can bend your left knee and press into your foot for support.Interlace your fingers to hold your leg behind your thigh, or use a strap or towel around the top of your foot.Hold this stretch for 30 seconds.Repeat on the left side.Repeat 2 or 3 times on each side.5. Pelvic tiltsThis exercise strengthens your lower back and abdominal muscles. It also increases flexibility.Muscles used:hamstringsrectus abdominissacral musclesgluteus maximusLie on your back with your knees bent. While relaxed, your spine will have a slight curve so the base of your spine isn’t touching the floor.Engage your core muscles so the base of your spine presses into the floor.Hold for 5 seconds and then relax.Repeat 3 times, gradually increasing to 10 repetitions.6. Cat-CowThis yoga pose increases the flexibility of the spine and provides a nice stretch for your hips and abdomen.

    "articleTextBody": "Lumbar stabilization exercises can benefit almost everyone, but there are a few important things to know before you try these exercises at home.Jovo Jovanovic/StocksyMaybe you have a constant, nagging small pain in your low back. Or perhaps you’ve had chronic low back pain for as long as you can remember. Or one day you randomly bend over to pick up something, and your back seizes up. Around the world, low back pain is the leading cause of years of living with a disability, according to a research study conducted from 1990 through 2017. It is also the leading cause of work absences, according to a 2013 research review. Low back pain can cause you to dramatically slow down or restrict your everyday life. The low back is designed to be mobile and to stabilize us for the load that life presents us with. There are many possible reasons for low back pain, though. Healing often requires consultation with various health and medical professionals, who will consider the whole body’s structure, alignment, and movement patterns.Adding lumbar stabilization exercises to your exercise routine can be very effective for maintaining a healthy and supple low back and managing chronic pain.What are lumbar stabilization exercises?Lumbar stabilization exercises are exercises that strengthen the trunk to support the low back. These exercises aim to decrease or manage joint instability — which can lead to pain, spinal conditions, or damage to neurological structures.While most lumbar stabilization exercises focus on strengthening the surrounding muscles of the abdomen and back, other important considerations include: posturebreathing mechanicsconditioning the hips and shouldersLumbar instability can result from insufficient core muscular recruitment or weakness of the deep spinal muscles. Combine that with the forces acting on your spine every day, poor posture, and a sedentary lifestyle, and you’ve got the perfect storm of back pain risk factors.It’s important to note that seeing a doctor about your pain should be your first step. The causes of low back pain are so varied, and some conditions require medical attention before beginning any type of exercise. Still, re-education and better motor control are often needed to release overactive muscles and engage smaller, deeper muscles that support the spine. That’s where lumbar stabilization exercises come into play. Building well-rounded strength over time, while rebalancing your posture and refining movement patterns can go a long way toward helping you live with less pain.What are the benefits of lumbar stabilization exercises? Benefits of lumbar stabilization exercises include:a decrease in lower back pain improved postureimproved core stabilityan increase in neuromuscular control, strength, and endurance of spinal musclesa cost-effective maintenance toolA 2019 study found that lumbar stabilization exercises were the most effective treatment (compared with walking, stretching, or general exercise) for decreasing low back pain during rest and physical activity. Muscular endurance improved and radiating pain significantly decreased. Often, combining lumbar stability exercises with other conditioning methods can be very effective for decreasing pain. A study from 2015 found that gluteal strengthening exercises along with lumbar stabilization exercises were most effective for decreasing low back pain.Some 2015 research suggests that lumbar stabilization exercises may offer better long-term results than general exercise alone when treating disk herniations. When are lumbar stabilization exercises a good idea?Chances are, if you’re interested in lumbar stability exercises, your doctor or physical therapist has recommended them for rehabilitation or fitness. You should always follow their recommendations for integrating lumbar stabilization exercises into your daily routine.Especially when in acute pain, follow your physical therapist’s or doctor’s advice on whether it’s a good time to begin lumbar stability exercises. If larger movements are painful, it may be best to focus on diaphragmatic breathing and gentle abdominal bracing as a first step. When your pain has decreased and you get the go-ahead from your doctor or physical therapist, you can add regular lumbar stabilization exercises to your fitness program for overall strength and maintenance. These deep core exercises benefit everyone, even if back pain is not a concern.You’ll learn many lumbar stabilization exercises in movement modalities such as Pilates or physical therapy. When working with a trained instructor or therapist, you’ll begin with basic, foundational exercises, and they’ll teach you plenty of options for progression as you become stronger. What muscles are used for lumbar stabilization?The primary muscles you’ll strengthen to enhance your lumbar stability are:transverse abdominuspelvic floormultifiduserector spinaequadratus lumborum internal and external obliquesThe secondary, or supporting muscles, for lumbar stability are:gluteal muscleshamstringsquadricepsdiaphragm4 lumbar stabilization exercisesWhen you’re first starting out, it’s highly recommended that you work with a professional trainer, physical therapist, or Pilates instructor. They can analyze your movement patterns and body as a whole, and they can choose exercises with progressions suitable to your unique needs.Diaphragmatic breathing and abdominal bracingLying on your back, with your knees bent, place your hands on either side of your ribcage. Inhale through your nose, and feel the breath move beneath your hands and in the back of your ribcage. Imagine your ribcage as a balloon — as you take air in, it expands in all directions.Exhale, and feel your hands sliding toward one another as your ribcage narrows down toward the floor and into the center of the body. Aim to keep your neck, shoulders, and chest relaxed, and feel the back of your rib cage connected to the floor.Maintain your neutral pelvis (neither tucked nor overly arched). Inhale again.Then exhale, imagining a thick belt around your low back and low abdominals. Gently tighten and lift the belt as you feel your deep core engage. Aim for a gentle contraction in these muscles, without gripping or holding on to excess tension. You should be able to have a conversation with someone while contracting.BridgeLying on your back with your knees bent and your feet parallel and hip-width apart, inhale.Exhale, bracing your abdominals as described above. Engage your glutes and push your feet into the floor to lift your hips off the ground. Inhale as you release the position back down. Aim to keep your shoulders and neck relaxed throughout. Try to keep from overarching your back.Complete 8–10 reps.Side plank on kneesStart from a seated position on your side, on one hip, with your legs bent and stacked next to you. Bend your elbow and lower your forearm to the ground next to you.Exhale to push your forearm into the floor and lift your hips into the air.Inhale to lower your hips halfway.Exhale to lift your hips up again. Repeat 8–10 times, then inhale as you lower your hips all the way down with control. Repeat everything on the other side. Bird dogStart on all fours, with your knees directly underneath your hips and your hands underneath your shoulders.Aim for a neutral position in your spine.Exhale to draw the abdominals in and up. Without shifting your weight or arching your back, lift one leg behind you and lift your opposite arm in front.Breathe and hold the position for 3 slow counts.Inhale with control to return your leg and hand to the mat.Complete 6–8 reps and then repeat on the other side. The bottom lineLumbar stabilization exercises are an effective way to manage low back pain and joint instability. These exercises strengthen and support the structure of the back and your body as a whole. They can be progressed to a more advanced level, though it’s often a good idea to talk with a doctor or physical therapist to see what you are ready for. It’s important to consult your medical team and work with a professional to find an individualized program suitable for your unique needs.In time, with the right program and practice, you’ll likely be on your way to less pain, more core strength, and better quality of life.",

    "articleTextBody": "What are McKenzie exercises?Many people experience some form of back pain in their lifetime. In the United States, back pain affects 75 to 85 percent of all adults. If you have back pain, it’s best to follow up with your healthcare provider to determine what’s causing it. This can help you find the safest, most effective treatment option.For some, this includes following the McKenzie method, sometimes called mechanical diagnosis and therapy. It includes a set of guidelines for evaluating someone’s movement as well as exercises designed to improve spinal mobility and posture.To reap the full benefits of the McKenzie method, it’s best to work with a physical therapist who can give you a proper evaluation.Still, you can try a few McKenzie exercises at home for back pain relief.How to safely try McKenzie exercisesThe McKenzie method isn’t for everyone. If you’ve had back surgery, it’s best to avoid this program. You should also avoid it if you have a serious spinal condition, such as a spinal fracture.It also doesn’t hurt to check with your healthcare provider before attempting these exercises. They can help you ensure that they won’t make your back pain worse.If you do decide to attempt McKenzie exercises on your own, make sure you move slowly. Abrupt movements might worsen your symptoms.If you feel the following symptoms in one or both legs, stop the exercise immediately:increasing painnumbnesstinglingYou might feel temporary back pain while doing the McKenzie exercises. This is expected. Wait until the pain subsides while doing one exercise before moving on to the next one.1. Lying on your stomachThis move reduces pain by unloading pressure on your lower back. It also helps align your spine.Lie down on your stomach. Place your arms at your sides.Turn your head to the side or face down.Hold for 2 to 3 minutes. Repeat up to eight times a day.2. Lying on a pillowTo support your lower back, add a pillow under your abdomen.Lie facedown and place a pillow under your stomach and pelvis. Place your arms at your sides.Turn your head to the side or face down.Hold for 2 to 3 minutes. Repeat up to eight times a day.3. Prone on your elbowsThis exercise will help restore the natural curve in your lower back. It’s also known as lying face down in extension.Lie down on your stomach. Prop yourself up on your forearms with your shoulders above your elbows. Hold for 2 to 3 minutes. Lower your upper body. Repeat up to eight times a day.4. Prone press-upsProne press-ups also help to restore your lower back’s natural curve.Lie down on your stomach. Place your hands under your shoulders. Slowly straighten your arms to lift your upper body. Hold for 2 seconds. Return to starting position. Complete 10 reps. Repeat up to eight times a day.5. Standing extensionThe standing extension helps the backward bending motion of your lower back. It’s also convenient to do since you don’t have to lie on the floor.Stand up straight. Place your hands on the small of your back.Bend backward as far as possible, keeping your knees straight. Hold for 2 seconds. Return to the starting position.Complete 10 reps. Repeat up to eight times a day.6. Lying flexionLying flexion is the first step in restoring the bending forward motion of the lower back. Once your back pain has improved, begin with this exercise in order to regain range of motion.If you don’t feel comfortable on your back, place your head on a pillow. This will reduce pressure on your spine.Lie down on your back. Place your feet flat on the floor, hip-width apart.Bring both your knees up toward your chest, keeping your tailbone down on the ground. Hold for 2 seconds. Return to starting position.Complete 6 reps. Repeat up to four times per day.7. Sitting flexionSitting flexion helps restore the forward bending motion of your back. It’s an intermediate version of lying flexion.Sit on the edge of a chair. Straighten your back and place your feet flat on the floor. Bend forward. Reach your hands in between your legs toward the floor. Hold for 2 seconds. Return to starting position.Repeat 6 reps. Complete up to four times a day. 8. Standing flexionStanding flexion, the most challenging exercise in this series, also increases your spine’s ability to bend forward.Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart.Bend forward at your hips, keeping your knees straight. Reach your hands toward the floor.Pause for 1 to 2 seconds. Return to starting position. Repeat 6 reps. Complete up to two times a day.Don’t worry if you can’t reach very far. This will improve over time. The bottom lineThe McKenzie method is one approach to treating back pain. While the method is typically used by physical therapists, there are some exercises you can try on your own. Just make sure to move slowly and get in touch with your healthcare provider if something doesn’t feel right.",

    "articleTextBody": "Symptoms of prostate problems and overactive bladderProstate problems and overactive bladder (OAB) are very different conditions. But for men, both can cause frequent and sudden urges to urinate.While this can be annoying and embarrassing, it can be treated.In addition to medical remedies, a variety of exercises can help reduce the number of times you feel the sudden urge to go to the bathroom. More about prostate problemsThe prostate is about the size of a walnut. It surrounds the urethra, which carries urine from the bladder.As men age, their prostates often enlarge. This puts pressure on their urethras.An enlarged prostate is also known as benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). The condition can contribute to an urge to urinate frequently, or the feeling that you may still have to go after you’ve finished urinating. Overactive bladder causesOAB occurs when the muscles that control the bladder no longer work properly. This is what causes the feeling that you have to use the bathroom more often.Drinking too much fluid — especially caffeinated beverages, alcohol, and citrus juice — can cause you to urinate frequently. Being obese can also put pressure on the bladder.Sometimes, OAB can stem from serious neurological conditions, such as Parkinson’s disease or multiple sclerosis (MS). Exercise can helpMuscles around the bladder can become weak as you age. This can also happen after prostate cancer treatment.Various types of exercises can be helpful for men with prostate problems or OAB. Kegel exercises can strengthen and train your pelvic floor muscles to help control urination.Exercises such as walking, jogging, swimming, and tennis are also beneficial. These and other aerobic exercises can help you maintain a healthy weight. What are Kegel exercises?Kegel exercises are designed to strengthen the muscles of your pelvic floor.They’re often recommended for women, especially after childbirth. But diabetes, prostate surgery, and OAB can also weaken the muscles in your pelvic floor.Kegel exercises can be done at almost any time. Plus, they don’t require special equipment.But it may take some practice and concentration to get the exercises just right. How to do Kegel exercisesFirst you must find the muscles of your pelvic floor. To do so, start urinating and after a few seconds, stop mid-stream.Concentrate on the muscles that you just used. Those are your pelvic floor muscles. Begin your Kegel exercises with an empty bladder. Lie on the floor with your knees bent and apart.Tighten your pelvic floor muscles for three seconds and then relax them for three seconds. Repeat a few times.Be sure to focus only on the pelvic floor muscles. Soon you’ll be able to do this while sitting or standing. Traditional exercisesRegular exercise provides many health benefits. Heart and muscle health depend on frequent physical activity.Exercise can help you lose extra pounds and achieve a healthy weight. Maintaining a healthy weight can help lower the risk of prostate problems, according to Rush University Medical Center.Exercise also helps balance the body’s hormones, which affect the prostate. The Mayo Clinic recommends striving for a healthy weight to ease OAB symptoms. If you need helpKegel exercises can be difficult to master. Your doctor may be able to help you learn how to isolate the key muscles.Lifestyle changes or medications may also be helpful. If you continue to experience symptoms, such as frequent urges to urinate, ask your doctor about other steps you can take. These problems can be embarrassing. But your quality of life can improve if you make the effort to address all your symptoms.",

    "articleTextBody": "Rice is a staple food worldwide, especially in Asian, African, and Latin American countries.Though some prefer to eat their rice while it’s fresh and hot, you may find that some recipes, such as rice salad or sushi, call for cold rice.Nevertheless, you may wonder whether it’s safe to eat cold rice.This article reviews the facts.Potential benefitsCold rice has a higher resistant starch content than freshly cooked rice (1). Resistant starch is a type of fiber that your body cannot digest. Still, the bacteria in your gut can ferment it, so it acts as a prebiotic, or food for those bacteria (2, 3).This specific type of resistant starch is called retrograded starch and is found in cooked and cooled starchy foods. In fact, reheated rice seems to have the highest amounts (4).The fermentation process produces short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), which influence two hormones — glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and peptide YY (PYY) — that regulate your appetite (5, 6).They’re also known as antidiabetic and anti-obesity hormones due to their association with improved insulin sensitivity and reduced abdominal fat (2, 5, 7).One study in 15 healthy adults found that eating cooked white rice that had been cooled for 24 hours at 39°F (4°C) and then reheated significantly reduced blood sugar levels after the meal, compared with the control group (1).Additionally, a study in rats who were fed retrograded rice powder determined that it considerably improved blood cholesterol levels and gut health, compared with a control group (8).Nevertheless, though these findings seem promising, further human studies are needed to confirm these effects.SummaryEating cold or reheated rice may help increase your resistant starch intake, which may improve your blood sugar and cholesterol levels.Risks of eating cold riceEating cold or reheated rice increases your risk of food poisoning from Bacillus cereus, which may cause abdominal cramps, diarrhea, or vomiting within 15–30 minutes of ingesting it (9, 10, 11, 12).Bacillus cereus is a bacterium typically found in soil that can contaminate raw rice. It has the ability to form spores, which act as a shield and allow it to survive cooking (13, 14).Thus, cold rice may still be contaminated even after being cooked at high temperatures.However, the issue with cold or reheated rice is not bacteria, but rather how the rice has been cooled or stored (9, 15).Pathogenic or disease-causing bacteria, such as Bacillus cereus, grow rapidly at temperatures between 40–140°F (4–60°C) — a range that’s known as the danger zone (16).Therefore, if you let your rice cool by leaving it at room temperature, the spores will germinate, quickly multiplying and producing the toxins that make you sick (17).While anyone who consumes contaminated rice may get food poisoning, those with compromised or weak immune systems, such as children, older adults, or pregnant women, may have a higher risk of infection (10).SummaryEating cold rice increases your risk of food poisoning from Bacillus cereus, a bacterium that survives cooking and may cause abdominal cramps, diarrhea, or vomiting.How to safely eat cold riceSince cooking doesn’t eliminate Bacillus cereus spores, some believe that you should treat cooked rice similarly to how you would treat any perishable food.Here are some important pointers to follow regarding how to safely handle and store rice (17, 18, 19):To refrigerate freshly cooked rice, cool it within 1 hour by dividing it into several shallow containers. To speed up the process, place the containers in an ice or cold water bath.To refrigerate leftovers, place them in airtight containers. Avoid stacking them to allow enough airflow around them and ensure rapid cooling.Leftover rice should not be left at room temperature for more than 2 hours. If so, it’s best to throw it away.Make sure to refrigerate the rice under 41ºF (5ºC) to prevent the formation of spores.You can keep your rice refrigerated for up to 3–4 days.Following these cooling and storing instructions allows you to prevent any spores from germinating.To enjoy your serving of cold rice, make sure to eat it while it’s still cold instead of allowing it to reach room temperature.If you prefer to reheat your rice, make sure it is steaming hot or verify that the temperature has reached 165ºF (74ºC) with a food thermometer.SummaryProperly cooling and storing rice helps reduce your risk of food poisoning.The bottom lineCold rice is safe to eat as long as you handle it properly.In fact, it may improve your gut health, as well as your blood sugar and cholesterol levels, due to its higher resistant starch content.To reduce your risk of food poisoning, make sure to cool the rice within 1 hour of cooking and keep it properly refrigerated before eating it.",

    "articleTextBody": "Your body temperature naturally varies after eating, although this slight change in internal temperature often goes unnoticed. Feeling cold after eating may be related to the type of food you’re eating or even your diet. That said, extreme body chills, shivering, or constantly feeling cold after eating could also be a symptom of an underlying medical condition. This article explores the main reasons why you may feel cold after eating and when to seek medical advice. Marta Mauri/Stocksy UnitedPotential diet-related causes Your diet may be responsible for your body chills. Studies have indicated that both intermittent fasting and calorie restriction may leave you feeling chilly. Very low calorie dietsYour calorie intake is a major regulator of your energy production and body temperature (1). Studies show that long-term calorie restriction with adequate nutrition is associated with lower body temperature in both lean and overweight adults (2, 3). As a result of the lower calorie intake, the body compensates by lowering its temperature to save energy.Furthermore, one study found that the more you restrict your calorie consumption, especially long term, the colder you’re likely to feel (2). That said, this decrease in body temperature will likely have you feeling cold at all times, not just specifically after eating. Intermittent fasting Intermittent fasting (IF) is an eating pattern in which you alternate between fasting and eating on a regular schedule. Many intermittent fasting schedules exist. Some methods involve fasting every day for 14–16 hours with an 8–10-hour eating window, while other methods involve alternate-day fasting. Intermittent fasting has been associated with many health benefits, but it has also been shown to increase cold sensitivity in mice lacking the sirtuin-3 (SIRT3) gene (4, 5). One potential cause is hypoglycemia or low blood sugar, which can occur in a fasted state. Low blood sugar levels may make you more sensitive to feeling cold or cause cold sweats (6). If you’re routinely feeling cold during intermittent fasting, this may be a sign that you need to consume more calories during your eating window. Summary Calorie restriction and intermittent fasting may lead to changes in your body temperature after eating. They may cause low blood sugar levels and a slower metabolism to compensate for the decreased energy intake.Some foods provide a cooling effect Certain foods may affect your body temperature, while others may simply exert a cooling sensation. Eating spicy food made with chilis While eating spicy foods can provide a warming effect in your mouth, it may actually cause a slight decrease in your body temperature (6).Chilis like jalapeño, habanero, and cayenne contain a chemical called capsaicin. This compound is responsible for chili peppers’ spicy kick. When capsaicin is ingested, the brain sends a message to your body that it’s overheated. In turn, this may cause your body to sweat. Sweat cools your body as it evaporates on your skin, lowering your internal temperature (7). Nevertheless, not everyone responds to spicy food by sweating. However, if eating a chili-laden dish causes you to perspire, you may experience a cooling sensation by the end of the meal. Peppermint tea contains a high content of the compound menthol. Menthol increases blood flow and provides a cooling effect, although it doesn’t reduce your body temperature (8, 9). While menthol doesn’t lower body temperature, you may experience a noticeable cooling sensation upon ingesting it. Cold foods and beverages Cold and refreshing food and beverages are often associated with cooling you down, such as enjoying ice cream on a hot summer day. Interestingly, eating or drinking cold foods may cause a slight decrease in your body temperature (10).One study found that drinking a cold beverage caused a 0.28°C decrease in body temperature after 5 minutes, on average (11). While this temperature change is statistically significant, a body temperature change this small likely goes unnoticed for most people. Furthermore, the body temperature was back to normal within 20 minutes of ingesting a cold beverage (11). Summary Eating spicy foods, drinking peppermint tea, and consuming cold foods and beverages may lead you to experience an overall cooling sensation. It could be a symptom of a medical condition  While feeling cold after eating is usually harmless, it can also be a symptom of an uncontrolled or undiagnosed medical condition. If you suspect you may have one of the conditions listed below, you should consult your healthcare provider.Hypothyroidism Feeling consistently cold after eating may indicate hypothyroidism. Hypothyroidism is a condition in which your body does not make enough thyroid hormones (12). Low levels of thyroid hormones may cause a decrease in metabolic rate and digestive function, among other complications (12). While low thyroid levels can cause various signs and symptoms, those with low thyroid levels often complain of increased cold sensitivity (13). In hypothyroidism, your metabolism tends to slow, reducing the amount of heat your body produces. While feeling cold may not solely occur after eating, low thyroid levels may leave you more sensitive to the cold after eating, as your body needs to exert energy to digest food (14). Anemia Anemia occurs when you do not have enough healthy red blood cells. Red blood cells are responsible for carrying oxygen from the lungs to the rest of your body. Feeling cold is a major symptom of anemia. This is a result of the lack of oxygen carried throughout your body. People with anemia often feel cold and experience body chills at any time of day, including after eating (15). Other symptoms of anemia may include fatigue, shortness of breath, and irregular heartbeats (16). DiabetesDiabetes is a metabolic disease that causes high blood sugar levels.Blood sugar spikes occur in people with diabetes due to either insufficient insulin production by the pancreas or the body’s inability to use insulin effectively (17). If left untreated or unmanaged, diabetes can cause kidney and circulation problems that may leave you feeling cold. Unmanaged diabetes may also result in nerve damage known as diabetic neuropathy, which may make you feel cold, especially in your lower legs and feet (18). However, these complications of unmanaged diabetes will likely leave you feeling cold all the time, not just specifically after eating. Idiopathic postprandial syndrome Experiencing body shakes and chills after eating is often a symptom of idiopathic postprandial syndrome (IPS). IPS is a condition that refers to symptoms of low blood sugar levels that occur without evidence of low blood sugar levels (19). People with idiopathic postprandial syndrome usually experience hypoglycemic symptoms 2–5 hours after a meal (20). In addition to body shakes and chills, people with IPS may also experience clamminess, dizziness, and weakness after a meal (21, 22). The cause of IPS is unknown. However, some researchers believe that eating foods with a high glycemic index, such as refined carbs and foods high in sugar, may contribute to the syndrome. SummaryFeeling cold at all times of the day, including after eating, may be a symptom of an underlying medical condition, such as hypothyroidism, anemia, diabetes, or idiopathic postprandial syndrome.The bottom lineA number of circumstances can cause you to feel cold after eating. While experiencing a cooling sensation after eating certain foods is normal, body chills, shivering, and noticeable changes in body temperature could be a sign of a more serious medical condition. However, feeling slightly cold after eating is relatively common and may simply indicate that your body is directing its energy at metabolizing and digesting the food you just ate.",

    "articleTextBody": "The common cold is a viral infection that affects the upper respiratory tract. The most common cause is a rhinovirus, and the most common symptoms are a stuffy or runny nose, sneezing, and a scratchy, sore throat.The first signs of the common cold are fairly obvious: a stuffy or runny nose, sneezing, and a scratchy, sore throat. Most people quickly recognize these early symptoms because the common cold is so ordinary. In fact, adults have an average of 2 to 3 colds per year.The common cold is actually a viral infection in your upper respiratory tract. A cold can be caused by more than 200 viruses. The most common are rhinoviruses. These viruses are easily spread from person to person or surface to surface. Many of these viruses can live on surfaces for hours, even days.While the common cold may indeed be familiar, there are some things to know about this ailment that can help you feel better, avoid future colds, or even prevent the spread of the virus to other people. Read on to learn how to cope with the common cold.What are the symptoms of a cold?Once you‘re exposed to a cold-causing virus, cold symptoms typically take 1 to 3 days to appear. The symptoms of a cold rarely appear suddenly.Nasal symptoms include:congestionsinus pressurerunny nosestuffy noseloss of smell or tastesneezingwatery nasal secretionspostnasal drip or drainage in the back of your throatHead symptoms include:watery eyesheadachesore throatcoughswollen lymph nodesWhole body symptoms include:fatigue or general tirednesschillsbody acheslow grade fever below 102°F (38.9°C)chest discomfortdifficulty breathing deeplySymptoms of a cold typically last for 7 to 10 days. Symptoms tend to peak around day 5 and gradually improve. However, if your symptoms worsen after a week or haven’t disappeared after about 10 days, you may have another condition, and it may be time to see a doctor.What’s the difference between a cold and the flu?The common cold and the flu may seem very similar at first. They are indeed both respiratory illnesses and can cause similar symptoms. However, different viruses cause these two conditions, and your symptoms will help you differentiate between the two.Knowing the difference between cold and flu symptoms can help you decide how to treat your condition — and whether you need to see a doctor.SymptomsColdFluSymptom onsetgradual (1–3 days)suddenSymptom severitymild to moderatemoderate to severeFeverrarecommonHeadacherarecommonSore throatcommonoccasionallyAchesmildmoderate to severeChillsuncommoncommonCough, chest discomfortmild to moderatecommon, can be severeSneezingcommonoccasionallyVomiting, upset stomachrareoccasionallyComplicationsrareoccasionallyAs a rule, flu symptoms are more severe than cold symptoms.Another distinct difference between the two is how serious they are. Colds rarely cause additional health conditions or problems. The flu, however, can lead to complications like: sinus and ear infectionspneumoniasepsisDiagnosing a coldDiagnosing an uncomplicated cold rarely requires a trip to your doctor’s office. Recognizing the symptoms of a cold is often all you need in order to figure out your diagnosis. Of course, if your symptoms worsen or last longer than 10 days, make an appointment with a doctor. You could actually be dealing with a different health condition, which your doctor will be able to diagnose.If you have a cold, you can expect the virus to work its way out of your system in about 7 to 10 days. If your doctor diagnoses a cold, you’ll likely only need to treat your symptoms until the virus has had a chance to run its course. These treatments can include using over-the-counter (OTC) cold medications, staying hydrated, and getting plenty of rest.If you have the flu, the virus may take the same amount of time as a cold to fully disappear. But if you notice your symptoms are getting worse after day 5, or if you don’t start feeling better after a week, it’s a good idea to follow up with your doctor, as you may have developed another condition. If you have the flu, you may benefit from taking an antiviral flu medication early in the virus’ cycle. Rest and hydration are also very beneficial for people with the flu. Much like the common cold, the flu just needs time to work its way through your body.Learn more about diagnosing a cold.If you need help finding a primary care doctor, then check out our FindCare tool here.Treatment for adultsIllustration by Yaja’ MulcareThe common cold is a viral infection in your upper respiratory tract. Viruses cannot be treated with antibiotics. In most cases, viruses like the cold just need to run their course. You can treat the symptoms of the infection, but you can’t actually treat the infection itself.Cold treatments generally fall into two main categories: over-the-counter (OTC) medications and home remedies. Over-the-counter (OTC) medicationsThe most common OTC medications used for colds include:Decongestants. Decongestant medications help ease nasal congestion and stuffiness.Antihistamines. Antihistamines help prevent sneezing and also ease runny nose symptoms.Pain relievers. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), naproxen (Aleve), and aspirin can help ease body aches, inflammation, and fever symptoms.Common cold medications sometimes include a combination of these medications. If you’re using one, be sure to read the label and understand what you’re taking so you don’t accidentally take more than you should of any one class of drug.The most common side effects from OTC cold medications include:dizzinessdehydrationdry mouthdrowsinessnauseaheadacheIf you’ve previously received a diagnosis of high blood pressure, you should consult your doctor before using any OTC cold medications. Certain medications help relieve symptoms by narrowing blood vessels and reducing blood flow. If you have high blood pressure, this may affect blood flow throughout your body.Home remediesLike OTC cold remedies, home remedies for the common cold don’t cure or treat a cold. Instead, they can help make your symptoms less severe and easier to manage.The most effective and common home remedies for a cold include:Gargling with salt water. A salt water gargle can help coat your throat and ease irritation.Drinking plenty of fluids. Staying well hydrated helps you replace fluids you’ve lost while also helping relieve congestion. Using vapor rub. Vapor rub topical ointments help open your airways and ease congestion.Getting lots of rest. Getting plenty of rest helps your body save energy to let the virus run its course.Zinc lozenges. Zinc lozenges may reduce how long cold symptoms last if they’re taken at the very start of your symptoms. Echinacea. According to research, echinacea may be effective at reducing the duration of a cold in some cases.Learn about more home remedies for cold symptoms.Treatment for childrenThe Food and Drug Administration (FDA) doesn’t recommend OTC medications for cough and cold symptoms in children younger than 2 because these medications could cause serious and potentially life threatening side effects. Manufacturers voluntarily label these cough and cold products: “Do not use in children under 4 years of age.“You may be able to help ease a child’s cold symptoms with these home remedies:Rest. Children who have a cold may be more tired and irritable than normal. If possible, let them stay home from school and rest until the cold has cleared.Hydration. It’s very important that children with a cold get plenty of fluids. Colds can dehydrate them quickly. Make sure they’re drinking regularly. Water is great. Warm drinks like tea can pull double duty as a sore throat soother.Food. Kids with a cold may not feel as hungry as usual, so look for ways to give them calories and fluids. Smoothies and soups are two good options.Salt water gargles. Salt water gargles aren’t the most pleasant experience, but gargling with warm, salty water can help soothe sore throats. Saline nasal sprays can also help clear nasal congestion. Warm baths. A warm bath may help ease mild aches and pains that are common with a cold.A cool mist humidifier. A cool mist humidifier can help decrease nasal congestion. Don’t use a warm mist humidifier, as it can cause swelling in the nasal passages, making it more difficult to breathe. Bulb syringe. Nasal suctioning with a bulb syringe works well to clear babies‘ nasal passages. Older children typically resist bulb syringes.Learn more about treating colds in children.How long does a cold last?The average common cold lasts anywhere from 7 to 10 days, but they can last as long as 2 weeks. Depending on your overall health, you may have symptoms for more or less time. For example, people who smoke or have asthma may experience symptoms for a longer period of time. If your symptoms don’t ease or disappear within 7 to 10 days, make an appointment to see a doctor. If your symptoms begin worsening after 5 days, it’s also important to see a doctor. Symptoms that don’t go away or get worse could be a sign of a bigger problem, such as the flu or strep throat.Learn more about what you can expect throughout your cold’s duration.What food should you eat if you have a cold?When you’re sick, you might not feel like eating at all, but your body still needs the energy that food provides. The following foods may be extra helpful for your cold recovery:Chicken noodle soupThe salty soup is a classic “treatment” for all kinds of illnesses. It’s especially great for colds. Warm liquids are good for helping open up your sinuses so you can breathe more easily, and the salt from the soup can ease irritated throat tissue.Hot teaWarm drinks like tea are great for colds. Add honey for a cough-busting boost. Slices of ginger may also reduce inflammation and ease congestion. Try to stay away from coffee, though. Caffeine can interfere with medications, and it may increase your risk of dehydration.YogurtYogurt contains billions of healthy bacteria that can boost your gut health. Having a healthy microbiome in your gut may help your body fight any number of illnesses and conditions, including a cold.PopsiclesLike hot tea, popsicles may help numb and ease the pain of a sore throat. Look for low sugar varieties or make your own “smoothie” pop with yogurt, fruit, and natural juices.The most important thing to remember when you have a cold is to stay hydrated. Drink water or warm tea regularly. Avoid caffeine and alcohol while you’re recovering from a cold. Both can make your cold symptoms worse.Learn more about what you should eat and drink to soothe a sore throat.Risk factors for the common coldCertain conditions may increase your risk of catching a cold. These include:Time of year. Colds can happen any time of year, but they’re more common in the fall and winter, or during rainy seasons. We spend more time inside when it’s cold and wet, which increases the chance of the virus spreading.Age. Children under age 6 are more likely to develop colds. Their risk is even higher if they’re in day care or a child care setting with other kids. Environment. If you’re around a lot of people, such as on a plane or at a concert, you’re more likely to encounter rhinoviruses. Compromised immune system. If you have a chronic illness or have been sick recently, you may be more likely to pick up a cold virus.Smoking. People who smoke have an increased risk of catching a cold, and their colds tend to be more severe. Lack of sleep. Irregular or inadequate sleep can affect your immune system, which may make you more susceptible to cold viruses.Learn more about the risk factors for a cold.How to protect yourself from a coldUncomplicated colds are a minor illness, but they’re inconvenient and can certainly make you feel miserable. You can’t get a vaccine to prevent colds like you can the flu. But you can do a few key things during cold season to help you avoid picking up a cold virus.Tips for cold preventionWash your hands. Washing your hands with soap and water is the best way to stop the spread of germs. Use alcohol-based hand sanitizer gels and sprays as a last resort when you can’t get to a sink.Avoid sick people. This is reason number one why sick people shouldn’t go to work or school. It’s very easy to spread germs in tight quarters like offices or classrooms. If you notice someone isn’t feeling well, go out of your way to avoid them. Be sure to wash your hands if you come into contact with them.Take care of your gut. Eat plenty of bacteria-rich foods like yogurt, or take a daily probiotic supplement. Keeping your gut bacteria healthy can help boost your overall health.Don‘t touch your face. Cold viruses can live on your body without making you sick, but once you touch your mouth, nose, or eyes with infected hands, you’ll likely get sick. Avoid touching your face, or wash your hands before you do so.Check out more tips for cold prevention.How to protect othersWhen a person contracts a cold-causing virus, it can be spread to others through the air, on surfaces, and through close, personal contact. People carrying the virus can also leave virus behind on shared surfaces like doorknobs and computers. If you‘re sick with a cold, it’s important to be a good neighbor, family member, or friend and take steps to protect those around you when possible. Tips for protecting othersWash your hands. Washing your hands protects you, but it also protects others. When you wash your hands, you reduce the risk of spreading the virus elsewhere in your home, school, or workplace.Stay at home. While you’re sick or your child is sick, stay home if possible. You need the rest, and it can help prevent spreading the virus to others.Avoid contact. Though it may be tempting to show love to another person, it’s for their own health that you avoid hugging, kissing, or shaking hands while you‘re sick. If you must greet someone, try an elbow bump.Cough into your elbow. If you feel a sneeze or cough coming on, grab a tissue to cover it. If you don’t have one, sneeze or cough into your elbow, not your hands. If you accidentally use your hands, wash them immediately.Disinfect regularly. Pick up a container of disinfecting wipes and give all high touch surfaces, like doorknobs, kitchen counters, appliances, and remotes, a quick cleaning if you or someone in your home is sick.When to see a doctorColds can make you feel miserable. But you’re unlikely to need to see your doctor if you have a cold. Most cold viruses will work their way through your body in 7 to 10 days. Symptoms are usually at their worst 5 days after you first notice them. As uncomfortable as it may be, using OTC medications and home remedies are typically the best way to deal with a typical, uncomplicated cold. However, there are some instances when you may need to see a doctor about your cold symptoms. Consider getting medical attention in the following situations:Severe or worsening symptoms. If your symptoms seem more severe than usual (for example, a cough or headaches that are worse than usual), it’s time to see a doctor. Symptoms that persist. If symptoms of your cold last more than 10 days, make an appointment to see your doctor. Difficulty breathing. If you find it hard to breathe or have shortness of breath, get care right away.High or persistent fever. If you have a fever higher than 103°F (39.4°C) or your child has a fever of 102°F (38.9°C) or above, see a doctor. Also, get medical care if you or your child has a fever of 100.4°F (38°C) or higher for more than 3 days.Symptoms in a child under 3 months. If your infant is showing signs of a cold, including lethargy or a fever of 100.4°F (38°C) or higher, see a doctor immediately.High risk medical conditions. If your cold persists and you fall into a high risk medical category, you should see your doctor. In the event you have something other than a cold, you could be at risk of complications. High risk medical categories include: children under age 5adults over 65pregnant peoplepeople with medical conditions like asthma, diabetes, and heart diseaseThe bottom lineThe common cold is precisely that — common. In fact, adults have an average of 2 to 3 colds every year. That means most people know what a cold is as soon as symptoms begin to develop.Colds can be quite uncomfortable. Symptoms like a runny or stuffy nose, headache, cough, and loss of smell or taste can make for a miserable few days. But after 7 to 10 days, most people will start to feel better. There are no cures or treatments that will end a cold. The cold is a virus that has to run its course until it’s gone. Treatments for a common cold include OTC medications to ease congestion or sneezing. Home remedies like salt gargles can also ease symptoms, while rest and hydration can help your body recover from a cold.Sometimes, a cold can be mistaken for other upper respiratory infections or infections like the flu. If your symptoms seem more severe or don’t ease after a week, make an appointment to see a doctor.",

But caffeine content in a cold brew can vary depending on such factors as brand, bean-to-water ratio, and brewing time.Cold brew coffee is a type of coffee made by steeping coffee grounds in cold or room temperature water for 8–24 hours.This results in a caffeinated beverage with a strong, distinct flavor that’s less acidic than regular coffee.Besides the differences in taste and temperature, cold brew differs from other coffee drinks in its caffeine content.This article explores how cold brew stacks up against other types of coffee in terms of caffeine content.Martí Sans/Stocksy UnitedHow much caffeine is in cold brew?Most varieties of cold brew use more coffee beans and less water than regular coffee.On average, a cup of cold brew coffee contains around 200 mg of caffeine per 16 ounces (473 mL).However, the caffeine content can vary quite a bit between different brands.For example, a 16-ounce (473-mL) cold brew from Starbucks contains 205 mg of caffeine, while a 16-ounce (473-mL) cold brew from Dunkin’ Donuts provides 260 mg of caffeine (1, 2).Additionally, many factors can influence how much caffeine is in cold brew, including the (3):Amount of coffee beans. Using a higher ratio of coffee beans to water can increase the caffeine content.Serving size. Larger coffee drinks contain more caffeine.Coffee bean type. Some types of coffee beans contain higher concentrations of caffeine.Water temperature. Hot water extracts more caffeine from the coffee beans than cold water.Grind size. Coffee beans that are more finely ground have a greater total surface area, resulting in a higher amount of caffeine.Brewing time. Steeping your coffee beans for a longer time increases the amount of caffeine present in the final product.As such, the exact amount of caffeine found in cold brew and other coffee drinks may vary.SummaryCold brew usually contains around 200 mg of caffeine per 16 ounces (473 mL). Yet, several factors influence the caffeine content, including the amount of coffee beans used, serving size, type of bean, water temperature, grind size, and brewing time.Cold brew vs. other coffee drinksEven though most varieties of cold brew use more coffee beans than hot coffee, cold brew is slightly lower in caffeine.This is because more caffeine is extracted when coffee is brewed with hot water.However, cold brew is slightly higher in caffeine than iced coffee. Additionally, a 16-ounce (473-mL) serving of cold brew also contains more caffeine than a 1.5-ounce (44-mL) serving of espresso.For reference, here’s how much caffeine is found in various coffee drinks at Starbucks (1):Serving sizeCaffeine contentCold brew16 ounces (473 mL)205 mgHot coffee16 ounces (473 mL)210–360 mgIced coffee16 ounces (473 mL)165 mgEspresso1.5 ounces (44 mL)150 mgSummaryAlthough cold brew is made using more coffee beans than hot coffee, it may have slightly less caffeine in some cases. However, cold brew generally has more caffeine than iced coffee and espresso.The bottom lineCold brew is a type of coffee made by steeping ground coffee beans in cold or room temperature water for 8–24 hours.It usually contains around 200 mg of caffeine per 16 ounces (473 mL), but the caffeine content can vary based on many factors.Compared with hot coffee, cold brew may be lower in caffeine, depending on the brand. However, it contains more caffeine than some other types of coffee, including iced coffee and espresso.Just one thingTry this today: You can easily adjust the amount of coffee in your cold brew by switching up the ratio of concentrate and water that you use. Changing the type and grind size of coffee beans is another easy way to customize your cold brew!",

Most resolve on their own with rest and over-the-counter medications.miniseries/Getty ImagesThe average adult gets a cold 2–4 times every year. One reason this mild type of infection is so common is that hundreds of viruses can lead to it. More than 200 different viruses can cause a cold, and most of them are highly contagious. Rhinoviruses are the most common causes of colds. But other viruses, such as adenoviruses, coronaviruses, human parainfluenza virus (HPIV), and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), can also lead to mild upper respiratory symptoms or common colds. In most cases, you can treat a common cold at home with rest and other home remedies, and most colds resolve after about a week.This article reviews the most common types of colds, including their symptoms, stages, and duration.What are the most common types of colds?More than 200 viruses can lead to the common cold. Here are the most common types:RhinovirusAccording to the American Lung Association, 10–40% of all colds are caused by a rhinovirus. There are 100 types of rhinoviruses. They are highly contagious but generally very mild. CoronavirusThere are about six types of seasonal coronaviruses that can infect humans and cause illness.Most types of coronavirus result in mild to moderate symptoms of respiratory infections known as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).The best-known type of coronavirus is SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19. HPIVHPIV is most likely to cause symptoms in young children and older adults, but anyone can become ill if they contract this common virus. Typically, people with HPIV have very similar symptoms to people with colds caused by rhinovirus, such as a sore throat, sneezing, and congestion. Symptoms of HPIV are often mild and will resolve on their own with rest and over-the-counter (OTC) medication.AdenovirusAdenoviruses are another common virus type that can lead to colds. There are about 50 types of adenovirus. In addition to colds, they can lead to more serious infections, including bronchitis and pneumonia. Adenoviruses can also infect the lining of the eye and are often the virus responsible for conjunctivitis (pink eye).RSVRSV is a common virus that is very similar to rhinovirus. It spreads quickly and typically causes mild respiratory symptoms. It’s slightly more common in young children and people over 70 years old, but anyone can contract RSV and develop symptoms at any time. It’s possible for RSV to progress to more serious infections, but you can typically treat it at home with rest and OTC medications.Do you need to see a doctor for a cold?Most colds are mild infections that will resolve on their own. Since colds are caused by viruses, they can’t be treated by antibiotics. Typically, unless you have cold symptoms that last for more than a week or get progressively worse, you don’t need to see a doctor.Read more about treating colds at home.What are the stages of colds?The common cold often lasts for around 7 days, but it’s possible for symptoms to last for up to 14 days. Days 1–3Symptoms typically develop on days 1–3. During this early stage of a cold, symptoms can include:coughingscratchy throatrunny nosecongestionsneezingreduced senses of taste and smellDays 4–7As your cold progresses, you might have additional symptoms. During days 4–7 (often called the active stage), you might have symptoms such as:headachebody achesfatiguewatery eyesrunny noseChildren might also have a fever during the active stage.Days 8–10Days 8–10 are called the late stage. Symptoms usually resolve by this stage, but you might still have a nagging cough or some lingering fatigue. If you’re still experiencing other symptoms, it might be a good time to make a medical appointment.How can you tell the difference between a cold and RSV?RSV and a cold are very similar. It can be difficult to tell the two infections apart. Typically, infections caused by RSV are more likely to cause symptoms such as fever, wheezing, and difficulty eating. Additionally, RSV is most active in the fall and winter, while the rhinovirus that causes colds is most active in the spring and summer.The table below provides a symptom comparison.RSV symptomsCommon cold symptomssneezingsneezingcoughingcoughingheadacheheadachesore throatsore throatcongestioncongestionwheezingfever difficulty eatingHow can you tell the difference between a cold and flu?Colds are typically milder than the flu. The flu can cause more severe symptoms and is more likely to lead to significant health complications, especially in people with a weakened immune system. Flu symptoms also tend to begin more suddenly. Most symptoms of colds and the flu overlap, although colds are more likely to cause congestion. Diagnostic testing can help healthcare professionals tell the difference between a cold and the flu.TakeawayThere are hundreds of viruses that can lead to the common cold. Rhinoviruses are the most common, but adenoviruses, coronaviruses, HPIV, and RSV can also cause mild upper respiratory infections. Typically, you can manage a cold at home with rest and OTC medications. You don’t usually need to see a doctor when you have a cold. If your symptoms are more severe, you might have the flu or another more serious infection. A healthcare professional can diagnose the infection and help you begin treatment.",

    "articleTextBody": "Cold sores are caused by the herpes simplex virus type 1. This virus is very contagious, meaning that cold sores are contagious until they go away completely, which usually takes about two weeks. Cold sores are small, fluid-filled blisters that usually appear on or around the lips and mouth. They can appear on their own or in small clusters.In most cases, the blisters will break, creating a scab that eventually falls off. Cold sores are caused by the herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1).HSV-1 is very contagious. You can spread the virus even when you don’t have any symptoms of a cold sore, though you’re usually most contagious when you have them. However, this is much less likely than if contact occurred when a cold sore was present.Cold sores are contagious until they go away completely, which usually takes about two weeks. This means the common belief that cold sores aren’t contagious once they’ve scabbed over isn’t true. Keep reading to learn more about how cold sores spread and how you can protect those around you when you have one.  How are they spread?HSV-1 is spread by close contact with skin or saliva, such as kissing, oral sex, or even sharing eating utensils or towels. The virus enters the body through a break in the skin, such as a small cut.Once you’ve contracted HSV-1, you have it for life.However, some people with HSV-1 never have any symptoms. This is because the virus can lie dormant in your nerve cells until something triggers its reactivation. You can still pass the virus to other people while it’s dormant. Things that can reactivate HSV-1 include:stressfatigueinfection or feverhormonal changes sun exposuresurgery or physical injury How common are they?HSV-1 is very common. According to Johns Hopkins Medicine, about 50 percent to 80 percent of people in the United States are living with HSV-1. In addition, most adults are exposed to the virus by the age of 50.However, reactivation of the virus tends to decrease in people over the age of 35. How do I know if I have the virus?If you’re worried someone may have spread the virus to you, keep an eye out for these early signs in any spots near or around your mouth:tinglingswellingsorenessIf you’ve never had a cold sore before, you might also notice:feverpainful mouth sores on your tongue or gumssore throat or pain while swallowingswollen lymph nodes in your neckheadachegeneral aches and pains How are they treated?There’s no way to get rid of HSV-1 once you have it. However, there are several things you can do to help manage your symptoms. Prescription antiviral medication can help speed up the healing process of cold sores. These often come as either pills or creams.For severe infections, you may need an injection of antiviral medication. Common antiviral medications for cold sores include valacyclovir (Valtrex) and acyclovir (Zovirax). You can also use over-the-counter cold sore treatments, such as docosanol (Abreva), to help heal cold sores.Shop online for cold sore treatments.To reduce redness and swelling, try applying a cold compress or ice cube to the area. You can also take nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, such as ibuprofen (Advil), to reduce inflammation.  How can I avoid spreading them?If you have cold sores, you can help prevent transmission of HSV-1 by:avoiding close physical contact, such as kissing or oral sex, until the sore is fully healednot touching your cold sore unless you’re applying a topical medicationnot sharing items that might have been in contact with your mouth, such as eating utensils or cosmeticsbeing extra careful about avoiding close physical contact with babies and people with weakened immune systems, who are both more vulnerable to infection The takeawayCold sores are small blisters that occur on and around your lips and mouth. They’re caused by a virus called HSV-1. Once you contract HSV-1, you have the virus for life. While you’ll always be able to spread the virus, you’re most contagious when you have an active cold sore.",

Its symptoms include:itching and tingling in and around your mouth, tongue, and throatswelling of the tissues in and around your mouthodd taste in your mouthitching ear canalsWhile symptoms can be mild and often don’t last more than 20 minutes, they may sometimes escalate into a more dangerous anaphylactic reaction, which is a medical emergency.Oral allergy syndrome is thought to occur when proteins in certain foods are similar to the allergenic proteins found in certain types of pollen, like grasses, birch, mug wort, or ragweed. Some people who have seasonal allergies may experience oral allergy syndrome after eating certain raw vegetables, nuts, uncooked fruits, or spices. This is called cross-reactivity. In these cases, your immune system is detecting similarities between the pollen and food proteins.Cold soresCold sores, or fever blisters, are sores that form around the outside of your mouth, usually on or around your lips. They’re caused by herpes simplex virus and are highly contagious. Cold sores are usually small but several may be clustered together.If you tend to get cold sores, you could also experience itchy mouth. Before the blisters appear, many people experience itching and tingling around their lips.Cold sores begin as small blisters filled with fluid that form near your mouth, cheeks, and nose. They break, crust over, and create a sore that can remain on your mouth for up to two weeks.AnaphylaxisAnaphylaxis is a life-threatening allergic reaction and a medical emergency that requires immediate care. An anaphylactic reaction can begin with itching, tingling, or swelling in the mouth if you’ve been exposed to an allergen. Common causes of anaphylaxis are allergies to:the venom of bees, wasps, or other insectsmedicationsfoodslatexMost of the time, people with allergies only have mild or moderate symptoms when exposed to an allergen. These include runny nose, rash, hives, watery eyes, mild itching, and tingling. However, it’s possible for a mild allergic reaction to escalate into anaphylaxis. This occurs when your body goes into shock.Symptoms of anaphylaxis can include:swellinghivestight feeling in your throatdifficulty breathinghoarsenessabdominal painnauseavomitingdiarrhealow blood pressurefaintingdizzinessrapid heart ratefeeling of impending doomSome people who experience anaphylaxis go into cardiac arrest, and death can occur.WarningIf you’re experiencing a severe allergic reaction, call 911 immediately. While severe reactions can resolve on their own, they also have the potential to escalate into anaphylactic shock, a life-threatening medical condition.Yeast infectionIf your mouth is itchy on a regular basis, you might have a yeast infection in your mouth, otherwise known as oral thrush. This is a fungal infection caused by the overgrowth of Candida albicans in the tissues of your mouth. Patches of thrush might appear on your tongue, the insides of your cheeks, tonsils, gums, or the roof of your mouth.Symptoms of oral thrush include:dry mouthraised, creamy-colored lesions that look like cottage cheeseburning or sore sensationrednessbleedingcracked skin on the outside of the mouth, often in the cornersmuted sense of tasteOlder adults, babies, and people with compromised or weakened immune systems are most susceptible to developing oral thrush.Itchy mouth and throatIf you’re experiencing an itchy mouth and throat, the causes could include:severe food allergiesallergies to medicationseasonal allergiesoral thrushanaphylaxisItchy mouth and lipsIf your mouth and lips are itching, the feeling could be caused by:cold soresoral thrushmild food allergiesItchy mouth after eatingHaving an itchy mouth after eating could be caused by:mild to severe food allergiesallergies to medicationoral allergy syndromeanaphylaxis Treatments for itchy mouthTreatment for an itchy mouth depends on the cause.Mild allergic reactionsFor mild allergic reactions, symptoms generally go away on their own within a few minutes, either when you spit out the food that caused it, remove yourself from the allergen, or digest the problematic proteins. Sometimes, you may need to take an over-the-counter antihistamine to combat mild symptoms.Severe allergic reactions and anaphylaxisSevere allergic reactions can be treated with antihistamines, medical attention, and in some cases, epinephrine. People with a history of allergic reactions should always carry an epinephrine auto-injector with them in case of emergency, as this drug can stop or prevent anaphylaxis.WarningIf you’re experiencing a severe allergic reaction, call 911 immediately, even if you’ve self-administered an epinephrine treatment. While severe reactions can resolve on their own, they also have the potential to escalate into anaphylactic shock, a life-threatening medical condition.Cold soresCold sores may be treated topically or through oral medication. In some cases, a doctor may recommend antiviral injections to combat the herpes simplex virus causing the sores. Some typical medications for cold sores include:penciclovir (Denavir)acyclovir (Zovirax)famciclovir (Famvir)valacyclovir (Valtrex)Yeast infectionIf you have oral thrush, your doctor may prescribe a range of antifungal treatments, depending on your level of health and the severity of the infection. These may come in pill form, as lozenges, or as an antifungal mouthwash. Preventing itchy mouthIn some cases, you can prevent your mouth from itching by:following your doctor’s treatment recommendations for cold sores and oral thrushavoiding allergens, including foodscooking fruits and vegetables instead of eating them rawavoiding certain medicationspeeling fruits and vegetables When to see a doctorIf you suspect you have oral thrush or think you may have a cold sore, make an appointment to see a doctor. The Healthline FindCare tool can provide options in your area if you don’t already have a doctor. It’s also important to see a doctor if you’ve had an allergic reaction to a food or other specific allergen that you can identify. A doctor will be able to prescribe epinephrine for future use and make other recommendations for home treatment for mild reactions.If you’re having symptoms of allergic reaction but aren’t sure what could be causing them, make an appointment with an allergist. An allergist will be able to administer allergy testing, which can pinpoint your allergens so you can avoid them in the future. You may also receive an epinephrine prescription once you have a diagnosis. The takeawayWhile your itchy mouth may be caused by mild, easy-to-treat conditions, it may be a warning sign for dangerous allergic reactions in the future. You should see a doctor if you’re experiencing an itchy mouth. With the proper diagnosis and treatment, you’ll be prepared to self-treat or get emergency help if and when you need it.",

They can feel an itching or tingling in the area the cold sore will appear.People also use many different remedies, even some that aren’t clinically proven, to try to prevent the itchy tingling area from becoming a large and painful cold sore.Popular remedies for cold sores that bounce around social media include:aloe veralip balmbaking sodapetroleum jellysalttea tree oilThe one that seems to come up most frequently is toothpaste.Toothpaste on a cold sore. Does it work?When you feel a cold sore coming on, chances are it’s the triggering of the herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) that has been lying dormant in your body.HSV-1 is responsible for cold sores, and there’s a possibility that it might be suppressed by a chemical in toothpaste. Many toothpaste brands include sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS). SLS can help dry out blisters like the ones found on a cold sore.Unfortunately, the only evidence that supports the claim that toothpaste is effective for cold sore prevention or cure is anecdotal. Anecdotal means that claims are based on personal accounts as opposed to clinical research.Home remedies for cold soresCold sores typically clear up on their own in a few weeks. Some home remedies you might consider to ease discomfort and promote healing include:over-the-counter (OTC) cold sore ointment, such as docosanol (Abreva)cold compressOTC pain relievers, such as creams with benzocaine or lidocainelip balm with sunscreenOther cold sore remediesAccording to the Mayo Clinic, study results have been mixed for alternative medicine cold sore remedies such as:propolislysinerhubarb and sage creamStandard cold sore treatmentTo speed up the healing, your doctor might prescribe an antiviral drug such as:Acyclovir (Zovirax)Penciclovir (Denavir)Famciclovir (Famvir)Valacyclovir (Valtrex)The takeawayRubbing toothpaste on an area you’re expecting a cold sore may or may not prevent the appearance of a cold sore.

    "articleTextBody": "OverviewCold sores are blisters that form on the lips, around and inside the mouth, and in the nose. You can get one or several in a cluster. Also referred to as fever blisters, cold sores are usually caused by HSV-1, a type of herpes simplex virus. They may also be caused by HSV-2, the virus responsible for genital herpes.Cold sores go through several stages. They may start out looking like red spots, and go on to form fluid-filled, red bumps. The bumps may leak and form open sores. Eventually, the sores will become crusty and scab over until they’re completely healed.Despite a lack of scientific evidence, some people believe that apple cider vinegar can be used to treat cold sores.One theory is that the alkaline nutrients in apple cider vinegar reduce the potency of the virus that causes cold sores to occur.Other people believe that apple cider vinegar has anti-infective properties, possibly making it useful for treating wounds, ulcers, and sores of all kinds. This theory dates back to Hippocrates (460–377 B.C.), who has been referred to as the father of modern medicine.Apple cider vinegar for cold sore benefitsApple cider vinegar has been shown scientifically to have antimicrobial and antibacterial properties. Since cold sores are caused by a virus, not by bacteria, applying apple cider vinegar to a cold sore can’t cure it.Apple cider vinegar is effective at removing dead skin cells, however. For this reason, it may help cold sores go away more quickly once they’ve reached the scabbing stage.Because it has antiseptic properties, apple cider vinegar may also be beneficial at reducing the risk of secondary infection in an existing cold sore.Treating cold sores with apple cider vinegarAnecdotal evidence often precedes scientific evidence. If you wish to try using apple cider vinegar to treat cold sores at home, here are a few methods you can experiment with:Diluted apple cider vinegarDilute apple cider vinegar with water in a 1:10 ratio.Soak a cotton ball in this solution and apply it to cold sores one or two times daily until the scabs heal over.Don’t use full-strength apple cider vinegar on your skin, as it may severely burn or irritate the area, causing scarring.Apple cider vinegar and honeyMix diluted apple cider vinegar with honey to make a paste.Apply the paste to the cold sore one or two times daily for 5 to 10 minutes.Gently dab with a soft cloth to remove. The honey may affix to the scabs, pulling them off prematurely if you remove this mixture too vigorously.Apple cider vinegar and tea tree essential oilTea tree oil may help reduce inflammation and has also been shown to have an antiviral effect on HSV-1 and HSV-2.Don’t use this at-home treatment if you have eczema.Dilute about 5 drops of tea tree essential oil in 1 ounce of sweet almond oil or another carrier oil.Combine the diluted oil with diluted apple cider vinegar.Use this solution as a poultice to treat cold sores: Apply one or two times daily using a cotton ball, and leave it on the area for five minutes at a time.Repeat until your cold sores go away completely.Don’t swallow tea tree oil or let it enter your mouth, as it can be toxic. Tea tree oil can irritate the skin, so it may not be appropriate for everyone.Apple cider vinegar for cold sore side effects and precautionsEven though it has alkaline properties, apple cider vinegar is an acid. It should never be used full strength on skin, especially on open sores, or in sensitive areas like around the eyes, mouth, or lips. It can cause serious burns, stinging, and irritation. It can also dry out skin, causing discomfort.Other cold sore home remediesIf you have a cold sore, it’s important to treat it promptly. This will help stop it from spreading to other parts of your body, and to other people. The fastest way to do this may be by seeing a doctor, such as a dermatologist.If you have a healthy immune system and don’t have atopic dermatitis, consider giving these other at-home remedies a try:the American Academy of Dermatology recommends using an over-the-counter cold sore medication with benzyl alcohol or docosanoleat foods high in lysineuse organic, unprocessed coconut oil, both topically and orallyapply diluted oregano oil directly to the cold soreapply witch hazel directly to the cold soremake a paste with the contents of licorice capsules and coconut oil, and apply it to the cold soreThe takeawayCold sores are caused primarily by the HSV-1 virus. Apple cider vinegar is an at-home remedy that is used by some people to treat cold sores. It hasn’t been scientifically demonstrated that this is an effective treatment, however.If you do want to try apple cider vinegar to treat cold sores, it’s important to dilute the vinegar before using it on your skin to eliminate the risk of burns or irritation.",

    "articleTextBody": "Tinnitus after a cold may result from fluid buildup in the inner ear, untreated infections, or ongoing inflammation. Sound therapy, cognitive therapy, and medications could help.Tinnitus is a persistent ringing or whistling in the ear that may range from mild to severe. It can be acute (lasting under 6 months) or chronic (lasting more than 6 months). The exact cause of tinnitus is not clearly understood, but the symptom is often associated with extreme noise exposure and other chronic conditions. Ringing in the ears may also arise or worsen after a severe cold or flu. Ringing in the ears after a cold: Why does it happen?Inflammation and infections in the ear may lead to tinnitus in some cases. Otitis media is the most common ear infection associated with a cold or other upper respiratory infections and allergies. Fluid and air buildup, as well as inflammation in the Eustachian tube in the middle ear, may increase the pressure behind the eardrum. This pressure could lead to ringing in the ears and some degree of temporary hearing loss. Prolonged pressure and infection may also damage inner ear structures and could result in long-term tinnitus.Other possible symptoms of otitis media include:pus bloodair pocketsswellinginner ear painheadachedamage to the eardrumYou may also be more likely to have tinnitus during or after a cold if you have untreated chronic allergies, Eustachian tube dysfunction, or sinus infections, all of which may increase the pressure in your inner ear.Read more about what makes tinnitus worse.Management options for tinnitus after a coldRinging in the ears usually resolves on its own once the cold symptoms are gone. However, if fluid and air have not been completely flushed out of the middle ear or if inflammation is still present, you may continue to have tinnitus after a cold. If you have intermittent or persistent ringing or buzzing in your ears that does not resolve within a few days, it’s important to see a healthcare professional, like a doctor or audiologist. They may want to examine your: ears for signs of eardrum damage, foreign bodies, earwax blockage, air pockets, and dischargeupper respiratory airways for signs of sinus infections and inflammationnervous system, especially cranial nerves innervating the face and arteries and veins close to the earA healthcare professional may recommend one or more treatments depending on the underlying cause of tinnitus after a cold. The first line of treatment for tinnitus after a cold is to address possible cold-related causes like infections, fluid buildup, and inflammation. In many cases, the cause of tinnitus cannot be established and management focuses on symptom relief. MedicationsA healthcare professional may recommend medications to treat tinnitus after a cold if this is related to inflammation, allergies, or infections. For example, they may prescribe anti-inflammatories and antibiotics for bacterial infections. If tinnitus is severe or significantly interfering with daily life, a doctor may also consider medications that act on the nervous system. Anti-anxiety medications and some antidepressants may affect the brain regions associated with hearing, which could relieve ringing in the ears.No medications exist to treat tinnitus directly, especially if the cause has not been established.A medical professional may also consider switching you to a new drug if you currently take a medication that may be causing tinnitus as a side effect. For example, some nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), loop diuretics, and acid reflux medications may cause ringing in the ears in some people. Sound therapiesSound therapy may help distract or reduce ringing in the ears, and some devices could also help if you experience hearing loss from tinnitus. Sound generators, for example, emit soft sounds that may compete with ear buzzing and offer some relief. A small 2022 study of 58 people with chronic tinnitus indicated that using sound therapy for 3 to 5 hours every day offered relief.Reducing aggravating factorsSome things may worsen tinnitus and could increase your level of discomfort. Consider the following:Avoid exposure to loud noises, including when using earphones.Engage in stress management techniques like meditation and deep breathing. Anxiety and high levels of stress can worsen tinnitus.If possible, improve your sleep routine by managing your room and body temperature and going to bed at the same time every day.Cognitive therapy Some research indicates different types of cognitive therapy may lead to tinnitus relief, especially in people with chronic symptoms.A 2018 study of 182 adults with chronic tinnitus indicated that mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) offered significant relief. A 2022 systematic review found that cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) was an effective therapy for tinnitus. CBT may also help with other symptoms associated with living with tinnitus, like insomnia, anxiety, and depression.Read more about treatment and remedies for tinnitus.TakeawayTinnitus, or ringing in the ears, may develop during and after a cold. Sometimes, the symptom is associated with ear or respiratory infections, fluid or air buildup, and inflammation of the inner ear. Tinnitus may resolve on its own once the cold symptoms are gone. However, some people may continue to experience buzzing or ringing in the ear if fluid or air is still trapped inside the ear. It’s also possible that a cold worsens existing tinnitus, which could result from other factors, such as eardrum damage, medication side effects, or neurological conditions.Treatment for tinnitus after a cold depends on its cause, but medications, cognitive therapy, and sound therapy may help.",

    "articleTextBody": "What is a summer cold?A summer cold is simply a common cold you catch during summertime. Some people may think you can only catch a cold during winter. Others might also mistake a summer cold for other issues, such as allergies. Contrary to popular belief, it doesn’t have to be cold outside to catch a cold.If you catch a cold in summer, it will be exactly like catching a cold in the winter. Even if it’s hot outside, the rhinovirus that causes common colds can spread and infect people just as easily. How can you tell it’s not allergies?It may be difficult to tell whether you have a common cold or summer allergies. However, if you know the major differences between the two, telling one from the other can be easy:You’ll have other symptoms Colds and allergies share the traits of sneezing, runny nose, congestion, and an itchy or sore throat. But a cold will also include other symptoms like coughing, sweating, and fever.Allergies will last longer Did your symptoms disappear after one to two weeks? If so, you probably had a summer cold that ran its course. If symptoms persist longer than two weeks and don’t go away, then you’re probably dealing with allergies.Symptoms will fluctuateLikewise, if your symptoms change in severity — start mild, worsen, and then return to mild (or disappear altogether) — you’re dealing with a cold. Allergies tend to be consistent and persistent.Onset of symptoms is different With colds, you’ll usually experience the onset of each individual symptom at separate times. With allergies, all of them will come on at once.Symptoms change when you travelIf you travel from one type of region to another and symptoms improve (or get worse), it’s more likely that you have allergies. This is especially the case if you travel from one place to another with vastly different pollinating plants and potential allergens.Nasal discharge will be differentSince colds are infections, the mucus after blowing your nose will be thick and greenish or yellowish. With allergies, mucus will be translucent and usually thinner in consistency. What are the best remedies?Of course, many classic winter cold treatments apply to summer colds as well. To treat a summer cold:Rest up. Make sure to get plenty of rest and sleep. Avoid excessive activity and stress that could challenge the immune system. Even though summer is full of tempting outdoor activities, you may have to stay inside and rest for long periods.Stay nourished and hydrated.  Drink plenty of fluids, especially water. Avoid beverages that could dehydrate, like alcohol, coffee, or energy drinks. Hot beverages like tea could be soothing and helpful to symptoms. Make sure your intake of vitamins and minerals is strong, especially of immune-boosting nutrients like iron, vitamin C, and zinc.Herbal remedies.  Herbs cannot kill or fight a cold. Still, studies show that some can support the immune system, helping it better fight colds. Popular herbs for fighting rhinovirus are echinacea, licorice root, elderberry, and garlic.Humidifiers and steams.  Humidifiers cannot directly get rid of a cold. But they can help relieve symptoms, especially runny nose, congestion, sore throat, and coughing. How long will it last?A cold in the summer will last about as long as any cold in winter. On average, a cold lasts about 10 days total, with symptoms drastically improving around day seven.Children tend to resolve colds much quicker than adults, usually in less than a week. Some adults, on the other hand, may deal with colds for up to about two weeks. This depends on age, health, genetics, and other factors.The more you take care of yourself and use cold care remedies, the quicker your cold will be likely to clear up. Go see your doctor if your cold lasts longer than two weeks.»MORE:Get an online treatment plan for your cold, flu, or sinus infection in as little as 15 minutes with Optum Perks Online Care.Optum Perks is owned by RVO Health.

But there are ways you can reduce your chance of getting one.Take care of your immune system. There are many ways to do this: eating nutritious foods, avoiding too much stress, and even taking supplements that contain immune-boosting natural remedies. Get plenty of sleep. Getting adequate sleep is essential to resetting the immune system each day so that it functions properly. Wash your hands. Make sure to wash your hands, especially in restrooms of public spaces and areas where pathogens can be prevalent. Avoid those who have a cold.  If you know someone has a cold, avoid interacting with them. If you get close to or touch them, make sure to wash up quickly afterward.",

    "articleTextBody": "You can transmit a cold virus to others during the incubation period, which is a few days before your symptoms start. This means you can possibly spread it to other people without even knowing it. The common cold is a viral infection that affects your upper respiratory tract. It’s a contagious disease, meaning that it can be spread from person to person.The incubation period for the common cold is typically between 1 and 3 days. This is the time period between exposure to the virus and when you begin to notice symptoms. Once you develop symptoms, recovery from an uncomplicated cold usually takes about 7 to 10 days. Your infection continues to be contagious as long as you have symptoms.Since your infection is contagious from before your symptoms start until they improve, you can potentially pass the virus to others for up to 2 weeks.This article will go into more detail about the common cold, how it’s spread, and what you can do to find relief.How does a cold spread?The viruses responsible for the common cold can enter your body through your nose, mouth, or eyes.Cold viruses can spread through the air. When someone with a cold coughs, sneezes, talks, or laughs, they can spread respiratory droplets through the air that contain the cold virus. If you inhale these respiratory particles, you can get a cold. You might also get a cold virus through direct contact. For example, someone with a cold may have the virus on their hands. If you shake hands with them and then touch your nose, mouth, or eyes afterward, you may develop a cold.Contaminated objects and surfaces can also transmit the virus. Commonly contaminated objects include door handles, shared eating utensils, and shared toys.According to recent research, the common cold virus can survive outside the body for 2 to 3 hours. What are the early symptoms of a cold?Colds tend to come on gradually. You may begin to notice symptoms between 1 to 3 days after exposure to the virus.The most common cold symptoms typically include:a tickle, soreness, or scratchiness in the back of your throata runny nosenasal congestionsneezinga coughmild body aches and painsheadachenot feeling well (malaise)fever, although this is less common in adultsSome of these symptoms may develop earlier than others, while some symptoms like a cough, for instance, may last longer than a sore throat or a runny nose. Can early treatment shorten a cold?There’s no cure for the common cold. Instead, treatment revolves around relieving your symptoms. Self-care measures you can take at home to help ease your cold symptoms include: drinking plenty of fluidsgetting plenty of rest using over-the-counter (OTC) medications to relieve symptoms like a sore throat, fever, and runny or stuffy noseSome remedies claim to shorten the duration of a cold when taken as soon as you start noticing symptoms.Here’s a look at some of the most popular cold remedies.Oral zincResearch suggests that taking zinc by mouth may reduce the length of a cold when taken within 24 hours after you first notice symptoms.A 2017 meta-analysis examined seven clinical trials that included a total of 575 participants with a cold. It found that, on average, taking zinc reduced the duration of a cold by 33 percent.A variety of dosages were examined during the clinical trials. However, there was no evidence that zinc doses over 100 milligrams per day were more effective than lower doses.Taking oral zinc can have side effects, such as nausea and other digestive symptoms. It can also interact with some types of medication. Because of this, it’s best to talk with a healthcare professional before using it as a treatment option.The recommended dosage of zinc is different for adults and children. Be sure to read the dosage instructions carefully before giving zinc to your child. Avoid intranasal zinc that you put up your nose. It has been linked with irreversible loss of sense of smell.Vitamin CA 2013 review of clinical trials found that regular vitamin C supplementation doesn’t decrease your likelihood of getting a cold. It can, however, sometimes reduce the duration or severity of your cold.It should be noted, though, that in these trials, vitamin C didn’t have much of an effect when taken after the onset of symptoms. EchinaceaThere’s mixed evidence regarding the effectiveness of echinacea for treating colds. A 2014 review of clinical trials found that echinacea only affected the duration of a cold in 1 in 7 trials reviewed. How long do colds last?It can take about 7 to 10 days to fully recover from a cold. You’ll typically start to notice that your symptoms gradually improve as time passes.A cough due to a cold may linger in some people. On average, a cough can last about 18 days (almost 3 weeks) before going away.Some people are at an increased risk of cold complications such as: bronchitis or pneumoniasinus infectionsear infectionsthroat infectionsThis includes people with conditions such as: asthmachronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)a weakened immune systemWhen to see a doctorBe sure to see your doctor or a healthcare professional if you or your child:have symptoms that last longer than 10 days without improving, are very severe, or begin to improve but then returnhave a fever higher than 103°F (39.4°C) (adult), above 102°F (38.9°C) (child), or above 100.4°F (38°C) (infant younger than 3 months)have a fever of 100.4°F (38°C) or higher that lasts longer than 3 daysexperience difficulty breathing or have shortness of breathnotice that underlying health conditions have worsenedAre there ways to prevent a cold?According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), colds are one of the main reasons people miss school or work. Adults typically have an average of 2 to 3 colds per year, while children have even more. There are a few steps that you can take to prevent coming down with a cold. Prevention tipsWash your hands. Since cold viruses can be present on your hands, try to wash your hands regularly for 20 seconds with soap and warm water. If soap and water aren’t available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer. Be sure to wash your hands: before touching your mouth, nose, or eyesafter being out and about in public spacesafter using the bathroom or changing a diaperbefore and after eatingbefore and after caring for someone who is sickDon’t touch your face with unwashed hands. Try to avoid touching your mouth, nose, or eyes if you haven’t been able to wash your hands or use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer, as this can allow the virus on your hands to enter your body.Keep your distance. Because people with cold symptoms can pass the virus to others, try to keep your distance from people who have a cold.If you’re currently sick with a cold, there are steps you can take to prevent passing it to others.If you have a cold:Stay home. If you develop a cold, plan to stay home until you feel better.Wash your hands. To prevent the cold virus from lingering on your hands, make sure to wash your hands with soap and warm water after you blow your nose, cough, or sneeze.Cover your mouth and nose when you cough or sneeze. Avoid coughing or sneezing directly into your hands. Instead, use a tissue or the crook of your elbow. Dispose of used tissues promptly.Keep your distance. Avoid having close contact with other people until you recover. Try not to shake hands, hug, or stand too close to other people while you have cold symptoms.Disinfect surfaces. Regularly disinfect high-touch surfaces around your house. A few examples include doorknobs, countertops, kitchen appliances, phones, and computer keyboards.The bottom line The common cold is a contagious viral infection with an incubation period of 1 to 3 days. This means it could take up to 3 days for you to notice symptoms after being exposed to the virus.Colds are contagious during their incubation period, which means that you can potentially pass a cold virus to others without knowing it. You remain contagious as long as you’re experiencing cold symptoms.There’s no cure for a cold, but taking oral zinc at the first sign of a cold or regularly taking a vitamin C supplement may help to shorten the duration of a cold.In most cases, you’ll simply need to let your body rest as it fights the infection and begins the recovery process. Drinking plenty of fluids and taking OTC medications to ease symptoms can help you feel better during this time.",

    "articleTextBody": "Tooth sensitivity caused by heat or cold typically occurs when a tooth’s outer protective layer, the enamel, has worn down. Receding gums that expose a tooth’s root may also be a cause.Getty Images/PeopleImagesHave you ever experienced tooth pain when sipping a hot cup of tea or slurping a cold smoothie? Chances are, sensitive teeth are to blame. While some home remedies can reduce discomfort caused by sensitive teeth, uncovering the underlying cause can help you treat and, hopefully, prevent this problem from coming back.Why is my tooth sensitive to heat and cold?Tooth sensitivity may occur as minor dental discomfort or as a painful sign of a more serious issue. It usually feels like a sharp or shooting pain through your teeth into your gums that can radiate across your head. That’s why, when eating cold foods, some people say they’re experiencing a “brain freeze.”Tooth sensitivity triggered by heat or cold tends to occur when a tooth’s outer protective layer, the enamel, has worn down. Enamel covers the parts of a tooth above the gums. A loss of enamel can expose the sensitive dentin of the tooth, the layer below the enamel that allows heat and cold to stimulate nerves.As well, the layer covering the root, cementum, can be exposed and cause sensitivity due to receding gums.Common causes of enamel loss that create discomfort with heat or cold include:cavitiestooth decaytooth injury, like a bruised tooth or chipped toothteeth grindinggum diseasereceding gumsharsh dental-care products, like whitening toothpastes and alcohol-based mouthwashessome kinds of dental work, like crowns and fillingsacidic foodstooth infectionforceful brushingsmoking and use of tobacco productslimited access to oral carepoor oral hygieneFor heat-and-cold-related tooth discomfort caused by a chronic underlying problem, pain will likely recur when eating and drinking — unless the underlying cause is corrected. In other cases, like with an acute tooth injury, pain may strike suddenly when exposed to heat or cold.What can cause a permanent crown to be sensitive to heat and cold?Crowns, inlays and bonding are used to repair cracked and worn teeth, preventing further damage. Such injuries can lead to tooth sensitivity with heat or cold exposure. However, tooth sensitivity may return if the dental treatments are:done improperlypoorly fittingshifting in the mouth due to loosening or breakageWhy is my tooth sensitive to heat and cold after a filling?Similarly, fillings are a type of dental treatment that’s linked to tooth sensitivity. Tooth sensitivity can occur after a dental treatment if:the filling or crown is too deepthe cavity isn’t fully removed and filledthe filling becomes loose due to tooth grinding, wear, or recessed gumsIf sensitivity doesn’t go away or gets worse, a root canal is needed.Why is my chipped tooth sensitive to heat and cold?While teeth are strong, it’s common for them to wear and break over a lifetime. Most tooth chipping is minor and causes no discomfort, but more significant breakage can lead to pain. When a tooth chips, enamel can crack off to reveal the dentin beneath — leaving teeth sensitive to heat and cold. Remedies and medical treatments for tooth sensitivityHome treatments can help ease some discomfort caused by tooth sensitivity. However, to permanently address tooth sensitivity, you’ll need to see a dentist. A dentist can help determine a treatment plan to address the underlying dental issue causing sensitivity. Home remediesSeveral home remedies are known to ease sensitive teeth. These include:saltwater rinsehydrogen peroxide rinse (diluted in warm water)honey and warm water rinseturmeric rubgreen tea rinsecapsaicin gel or mouthwashvanilla extractOTC productsA 2013 study suggested desensitizing over-the-counter (OTC) mouthwash and arginine-containing dental devices can help ease tooth sensitivity. OTC non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as acetaminophen, ibuprofen and naproxen, can also relieve pain.Prescription medicationsFor serious cases of tooth sensitivity, a dental professional might recommend a prescription-strength NSAID. A growing number of dental professionals advise against prescribing opiates because of their addictive properties.Diet and other changesChanging your daily habits, like your diet and lifestyle, can sometimes help ease tooth sensitivity. These changes are most effective when adopted in conjunction with other treatments. Change your toothpasteDesensitizing toothpastes are formulated to reduce the discomfort of sensitive teeth. A dentist can recommend various brands to try.Use a new toothbrushIf your tooth sensitivity stems from poor dental hygiene, cavities, gum disease, or rough toothbrushing, it’s probably time to pick up a new toothbrush. When choosing a toothbrush for sensitive teeth, it’s best to opt for soft bristles. Brush gently in a circular motion for about 2 minutes all over the surface of your teeth, on the inside and outside. Avoid acidic foods and drinksAcidic food and drinks tend to wear away tooth enamel, and can trigger sensitivity, especially when combined with heat or cold. If you experience tooth sensitivity, you may want to avoid the following foods and drinks until you get the underlying cause under control:soft drinkscitrus fruitspicklescranberriestomato and tomato-based foods, like ketchup and hot saucecoffeewineWhen to see a dentistIf you experience frequent tooth sensitivity, or extreme sensitivity that interferes with your ability to eat and drink normally, you should schedule an appointment with a dental professional. A dentist can identify the root cause of your tooth sensitivity, and create a treatment plan that will alleviate your discomfort. TakeawayTooth sensitivity is a common issue with numerous possible causes. Generally, it occurs when the enamel wears off the teeth for any number of reasons. Tooth sensitivity may stem from a tooth injury, disease, and new dental work, among other reasons. Addressing the underlying cause of your tooth sensitivity can help reduce your pain long term, while a variety of at-home, OTC, and prescription treatments can provide short-term relief.",

    "articleTextBody": "A cold typically resolves after about a week, although congestion, cough, and runny nose can linger. Your cold may be improving if you have more energy and your symptoms are milder.A cold is a mild viral infection that often lasts for about a week. Cold symptoms include:coughsore throatsneezingrunny nosecongestionfatigueachesGenerally, these symptoms are most severe in the middle of a cold, around days 3–5. By the last days of a cold, most symptoms will have faded and your energy will have returned to your usual levels. You might still have a lingering cough or some mild congestion and nasal discharge.This article takes a closer look at symptoms that signal your cold is almost over. What are the symptoms that indicate your cold is almost over?Colds typically end after about a week. Many people find that symptoms start to ease on days 7–10 of their cold. On these days, you might notice your energy picking up, and it might seem easier to work, attend school, and do daily tasks.You might still have some lingering symptoms. These can include:a runny nosecongestiona coughA runny nose and congestion can last up to 14 days, and it’s possible for a cough to last weeks. It’s common for nasal discharge in the final days of a cold to be yellow or green. This happens as a result of your immune system fighting the cold.What are the stages of most colds, and how long does each stage last?A cold is often broken into stages. People experience different symptoms in each stage and might feel sicker in some stages than in others. For instance, it’s common to feel worse in stage 2 than in stage 1 or 3. Stage 1Stage 1 lasts for 1–2 days. Symptoms in this stage are typically mild, and the most common symptom people report is a sore throat. You can also experience:fatigueslight congestionmild runny noseStage 2Symptoms normally increase on days 3–5, also called stage 2. This is normally when you feel the sickest. In stage 2 of a cold, you often have the following symptoms:congestionrunny nosebody achesheadachesneezingfatiguecoughStage 3Symptoms start to get better after about a week. This is stage 3. In this stage, symptoms are mild and might resolve completely. The remaining symptoms in stage 3 typically include cough, congestion, and runny nose.Does blowing your nose help get rid of a cold?Blowing your nose can help relieve some of your symptoms. It can make it easier to breathe and can make you feel less congested. However, it probably won’t make your cold resolve any faster.Plus, there’s evidence to suggest that blowing your nose can sometimes be harmful. Too much repeated nose-blowing can irritate your nasal passages and increase inflammation, making you feel worse. When nose blowing is done forcefully, it can even cause injuries such as nosebleeds and eardrum ruptures.What can you do to ease symptoms of a common cold?Typically, it’s best to recover from a cold at home with plenty of rest and some at-home remedies.Steps you can take to help relieve your symptoms include:staying hydrated by increasing your fluid intake (drinking tea, juices, nonalcoholic beverages)sucking on throat lozenges to relieve throat pain and reduce coughingtaking an over-the-counter (OTC) cough and cold medication to relieve your cough and feverusing saline drops and sprays to relieve nasal congestiontaking OTC pain medications such as ibuprofen to reduce inflammationdrinking warm beverages that can soothe your throat, such as tea with honeytaking a hot shower or bath, as the steam can help clear your sinusesusing a humidifier to help open nasal passagesDo you need to see a doctor for a cold?You don’t normally need to see a doctor for a cold. The common cold is caused by a virus. This means it can’t be treated with antibiotics. Since cold symptoms are typically mild, at-home treatment is typically best. However, there are times when it’s a good idea to see a doctor.See a doctor if:your symptoms haven’t improved after a weekyour symptoms are getting worse instead of betteryou’ve had a fever for more than 4 daysOTC medications aren’t helpingyou have symptoms that go away and then come backany of your symptoms feel severe or abnormalyou become dehydratedAny of the above could be a sign that your cold has become a more serious infection.TakeawayA cold typically resolves in about a week. Around day 7, your symptoms will often start to fade. You might still have congestion, a stuffy nose, and a cough. These symptoms can last weeks longer than other cold symptoms. As your symptoms fade, your energy levels should return to their usual levels. You’ll likely find it easier to do everyday activities.You typically don’t need to see a doctor for a cold. At-home treatment with rest, OTC medications, and the use of heat and steam to soothe your throat or open your nasal passages can help relieve your symptoms. If your symptoms last longer than a week, or if they get worse instead of better, it’s best to see a doctor.",

Stay hydrated by drinking lots of water, juice, tea, or clear broth. Avoid caffeinated drinks or alcohol, which can contribute to dehydration.Choose warm liquids. Tea, warm lemon water, and soup may help relieve congestion.Rest. Get plenty of sleep and try to relax. Gargle salt water. If you have a sore throat, gargle with 8 ounces of warm water mixed with 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon of salt.Use a humidifier. A humidifier may help decrease congestion by increasing the moisture in the air. Take an over-the-counter (OTC) cold medication. OTC medications might help ease coughing, congestion, a sore throat, and headaches. Ask your doctor for recommendations, and be sure to follow the directions.Is it safe to run if you have allergies? Colds and seasonal allergies share several symptoms, like a runny nose, congestion, and sneezing. As a result, it may be difficult to tell which one you’re experiencing.If your allergies are acting up, you’ll likely also have:an itchy nose itchy or red eyesswelling around the eyes The main difference between allergies and the common cold is itchy eyes. A cold rarely causes this symptom.Another difference is coughing, which is usually caused by a cold rather than allergies. An exception is if you have allergic asthma, which can cause coughing.Generally, it’s OK to run with allergies. But depending on the severity of your allergies, you may need to take extra steps to run safely and comfortably.Here’s what you can do:Check the pollen counts. Run outside when pollen counts are low. Pollen levels are usually lower in the morning. Avoid dry and windy weather. It’s best to run outside after it rains, which reduces the pollen in the air.Wear a hat and sunglasses. These accessories protect your hair and eyes from pollen.Take allergy medication. Ask your doctor for a recommendation. If the medication causes drowsiness, you may have to take it at night.Bring your rescue inhaler. If you have allergic asthma, your doctor might suggest bringing along an inhaler during your run.Run indoors. Consider running on an indoor track or treadmill, especially during pollen season.If you’re concerned about running with allergies, talk to your primary care doctor or allergist.The bottom lineRunning with a mild cold is usually safe, especially if the symptoms are above your neck. However, it’s also important to listen to your body. Instead of doing your usual running routine, you may want to try a less strenuous activity like jogging or brisk walking.If you have more severe symptoms, like a fever, hacking cough, or chest tightness, it’s best to avoid running. Overexerting your body could prolong your symptoms. By resting, you can help your body fight off the infection. This will allow you to return to your normal routine sooner rather than later.",

    "articleTextBody": "RSV causes a mild infection similar to the common cold. But, RSV is more likely to cause fever, wheezing, and difficulty eating. Both may be treated at home without medical intervention within around 2 weeks. Johner Images/Getty ImagesRespiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a virus that leads to a mild infection. It causes symptoms that are very similar to the common cold. RSV lasts about as long as the common cold, and you can typically treat it at home with rest, just like a cold. However, there are some differences. Several viruses can cause a cold, not only RSV. And not all symptoms of RSV and colds are the same.What is RSV?RSV is a common virus that causes infections in humans. Most RSV infections are mild and cause symptoms similar to the common cold, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).However, certain populations have a higher risk of developing a severe RSV infection, including:infantsolder adults over 60 years oldpeople who are pregnant Symptoms usually appear 4–6 days after contracting the virus and go away within 1–2 weeks without medical treatment. What is a cold?A cold is a very common, mild infection that affects the upper respiratory tract. Over 200 viruses may cause the common cold, but rhinovirus is the most common cause, according to the CDC. Adults have about two to three colds each year, while children typically have colds more often.Like RSV, cold symptoms may last up to 2 weeks. However, rest and over-the-counter (OTC) medications may help you recover more quickly.How are RSV and a cold similar?RSV infections and colds are both caused by the transmission of a viral infection. For example, if someone with a virus near you coughs or sneezes, their infected water droplets may enter your mouth, eyes, or nose, transmitting the virus to you. SymptomsRSV and colds share common symptoms in adults, such as: coughingcongestionsneezingheadacheThey also share common symptoms in infants, such as:irritabilitytrouble breathingloss of energyHow can you tell RSV from a cold?According to the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases, RSV infections are much more likely to cause fever and wheezing than the common cold.On the other hand, the common cold is more likely to cause a sore throat.The following severe symptoms in infants are also more characteristic of RSV:nasal flaring when inhalingchest retractions (“caving in”) around the ribs when inhalingbluish lips, nails, or skintrouble breathing, such as shortness of breath or fast breathingdecreased thirst or appetiteIf your child experiences any of these symptoms, get immediate medical attention.What is the treatment for RSV vs. a cold?In most cases, at-home remedies are enough to help you recover from RSV or a cold. These may include:taking OTC medications to manage symptomsgetting plenty of restdrinking plenty of fluidstrying steam inhalationusing nasal saline spraysgargling with warm salt waterusing a humidifier at homeIt’s important to speak with a healthcare professional before using any OTC medications, especially for infants and young children. They may recommend alternatives, such as using a cool-mist humidifier. What are the risk factors for RSV vs. a cold?Adults and children can get RSV or a cold at any time.However, the following risk factors may increase your risk of contracting RSV or developing the cold:the fall and winter seasons (September–March)being an infant or very young childbeing age 60 years and olderhaving a weakened immune systemhaving an underlying health conditionfrequently being in a shared space, such as living in a dorm, group home, or assisted living facilityMost infants contract RSV for the first time before their second birthday, according to the CDC.What’s the outlook for people who have RSV vs. a cold?RSV and cold infections are typically mild. Most people recover completely in under 2 weeks. However, it’s possible for a cold and an RSV infection to progress and become a serious illness, such as pneumonia or bronchiolitis.For infections caused by RSV, serious illness is more of a risk for:infantsadults age 60 years and olderpeople with heart conditionspeople with certain neuromuscular conditionsFor infections caused by colds, serious infections are more of a risk for people with:weakened immune systemsasthmarespiratory conditions\n{\n  \"@context\": \"https://schema.org\",\n  \"@type\": \"FAQPage\",\n  \"mainEntity\": [{\n    \"@type\": \"Question\",\n    \"name\": \"What does RSV cough sound like?\",\n    \"acceptedAnswer\": {\n      \"@type\": \"Answer\",\n      \"text\": \"An RSV cough may sound wet because of mucus buildup.

Antibiotics do not treat viruses, they treat bacteria.TakeawayRSV infection and the common cold are both caused by contracting a virus. Although they both cause mild symptoms like coughing, sneezing, and congestion, there are slight differences between the two conditions. Both conditions usually clear up on their own without treatment. However, sometimes infections may be severe and require medical treatment. If your symptoms don’t clear up after 10 days, worsen, or cause difficulty breathing, speak with a healthcare professional. They could provide a proper diagnosis and treatment plan for you.",

    "articleTextBody": "OverviewYou might enjoy a nice cold drink or ice cream on a hot summer day. But if your teeth are sensitive to coldness, coming in contact with these foods and beverages can be a painful experience.Teeth sensitivity to cold isn’t uncommon. In fact, about 40 million adults in the United States experience some type of tooth sensitivity. Understanding potential causes of sensitive teeth is key to alleviating pain. If left untreated, sensitivity can worsen and progress to the point where you avoid certain foods and drinks. What are the symptoms of sensitive teeth?The main symptom of tooth sensitivity is discomfort after eating or drinking something cold. This pain can occur suddenly, and the degree of sensitivity can be mild, moderate, or severe.Some people with tooth sensitivity also have pain while brushing or flossing, so it’s important to find a cause and start treatment. Experiencing pain while brushing or flossing may lead to poor dental hygiene. This can trigger further dental problems such as gum disease and cavities. Causes of sensitive teethTooth sensitivity can be minor or indicate a serious dental problem. You can’t diagnose tooth sensitivity yourself. If you have any sensitivity to coldness (or hotness), speak with your dentist. A dental examination can help your doctor determine the underlying cause, as well as the most appropriate treatment to eliminate pain. Causes of tooth sensitivity to cold may include:Forceful brushingVigorously brushing your teeth with a hard-bristled toothbrush can gradually wear down tooth enamel. This is the outer layer of the tooth which protects the inner layer.Worn tooth enamel can gradually expose the dentin layer of your teeth, which is the second layer where the nerve endings are. Drinking or eating something cold could irritate the nerves and cause sharp, intermittent pain in the mouth.Acidic foodsAcidic foods can also wear down tooth enamel and expose nerve endings. Examples of acidic foods include:lemonsorangesgrapefruit kiwiConsume acidic foods in moderation, especially if you develop sensitivity.Tooth-whitening toothpasteWhitening toothpaste can give you a brighter smile, but you may be sensitive to chemicals in these whitening agents. Regular use can cause discomfort and sensitivity. Mouthwashes containing alcohol can also make the teeth sensitive to cold.Gum diseaseRegular brushing, flossing, and dental cleanings are important for removing plaque and avoiding gum disease.If plaque builds up on the teeth or along the gumline, your gums can become infected and inflamed. This can eventually damage gum tissue, causing gums to recede and expose nerve endings on the root.Grinding your teethGrinding your teeth while sleeping can also wear down tooth enamel and expose dentin. If not corrected, teeth grinding can cause sensitivity whenever you drink or eat something cold.Tooth decayAn untreated cavity or a worn dental filling may also expose nerve endings in a tooth. And when exposed to coldness, you may feel pain or sensitivity in the affected tooth. Ways to treat sensitive teethYou don’t have to live with sensitivity to cold. Different options are available to completely eliminate sensitivity. Treatment depends on the cause of sensitivity, which is why you should speak with your dentist and have a dental examination. Treatments to stop pain and sensitivity might include:Fluoride treatmentYour dentist may recommend a fluoride treatment to strengthen your tooth enamel. You may also receive a prescription strength fluoride paste and a fluoride rinse.Dietary changesIn addition to fluoride treatments, eliminating tooth sensitivity may require dietary changes. This includes eliminating acidic foods from your diet, which can weaken tooth enamel.Healthier brushing habitsChanging how you brush your teeth can also eliminate sensitivity to cold. Switch from a hard-bristled toothbrush to a soft-bristled toothbrush, and don’t brush too vigorously. Be gentle and vary the motion of your toothbrush. Light bleeding while brushing can be a sign of brushing too hard.Wear a mouth guardSigns of grinding your teeth while sleeping include face pain, headaches, earache, and a stiff jaw. Speak with your doctor to see if you need a mouth guard. A mouth guard prevents you from grinding and clenching your teeth. If your enamel is worn, your doctor may also recommend fluoride treatments or a fluoride paste to strengthen the enamel.Dental proceduresCertain dental procedures can also alleviate tooth sensitivity. In cases of exposed nerve endings, your doctor may apply a special resin to cover sensitive, exposed dentin and stop your pain. If you have gum disease and gum recession, a surgical gum graft can protect or cover exposed roots, too.A gum graft alleviates pain by removing gum tissue from another part of the mouth and attaching it to an exposed area. Your dentist can also eliminate sensitivity by filling a cavity or performing a root canal to remove decay or infection from inside a problem tooth.Q:Ever since I had a permanent crown put in, my tooth has experienced sensitivity to cold. Why is that?Anonymous patientA:The tooth could be sensitive to cold due to:the bite being highgrinding or clenchingexcessive cementslight recession of the gum tissue exposing the edge of the rootnerve damage If it lasts more than a few weeks, you should have it checked by your dentist.Christine Frank, DDSAnswers represent the opinions of our medical experts. All content is strictly informational and should not be considered medical advice. Prevention and outlook for sensitive teethTreatment can completely get rid of sensitivity to cold. You’ll need to speak with your dentist and get to the root of the problem before discussing treatment options. Keep in mind that tooth sensitivity may return if you don’t modify your dental habits. To avoid future problems, continue practicing good dental hygiene. This includes brushing and flossing daily, and scheduling dental cleanings every six months. Also, limit acidic foods, use teeth whitening products sparingly, and wear a mouth guard if you grind your teeth.",

    "articleTextBody": "If you have a runny nose and a cough that’s making your throat sore, you may be wondering if you have a common cold that just has to run its course or a sinus infection that needs treatment. The two conditions share many symptoms, but there are some telltale signs for each. Read on to learn more about the similarities and differences, and how to identify and treat each condition.Cold vs. sinus infectionA cold is an infection caused by a virus that finds a home in your upper respiratory system, including your nose and throat. Over 200 different viruses are capable of causing a cold, though most of the time a type of rhinovirus, one that primarily affects the nose, is the culprit.Colds can be so mild you may only have symptoms for a few days, or a cold can hang on for weeks.Because a common cold is caused by a virus, it can’t be effectively treated with antibiotics. Some medications can help reduce symptoms, but rest is usually the main way to beat a cold virus.A sinus infection causing inflammation of the sinuses, also known as sinusitis, is commonly caused by a bacterial infection, though it can be caused by a virus or fungus (mold).In some cases, you can develop a sinus infection following a common cold.A cold can cause the lining of your sinuses to become inflamed, which makes it difficult for them to properly drain. That can lead to mucus becoming trapped in the sinus cavity, which, in turn, can create an inviting environment for bacteria to grow and spread.You can have an acute sinus infection or chronic sinusitis. An acute sinus infection tends to last for less than a month. Chronic sinusitis lasts for more than three months, and symptoms may regularly come and go.What are the symptoms?Among the symptoms shared by a cold and sinus infection are:congestionrunny or stuffy noseheadachepostnasal dripcoughfever, though with a cold, it tends to be a low-grade feverfatigue, or lack of energyCold symptoms are usually at their worst within a few days after the infection sets in, and then they usually start to subside within 7 to 10 days. Sinus infection symptoms may last twice as long or much longer, especially without treatment.Sinus infection symptomsSinus infection symptoms are similar to those of a common cold, though there are some subtle differences. A sinus infection can cause sinus pain and pressure. Your sinuses are air-filled cavities located behind your cheekbones and around the eyes and forehead. When they become inflamed, that can lead to facial pain.A sinus infection can also make you feel pain in your teeth, though the health of your teeth generally isn’t affected by the sinus infection. A sinus infection can also cause a sour taste to linger in your mouth and cause bad breath, especially if you’re experiencing postnasal drip. Cold symptomsSneezing tends to accompany a cold, not a sinus infection. Likewise, a sore throat is a more common symptom of a cold, rather than a sinus infection. However, if your sinusitis is producing a lot of postnasal drip, your throat can start to feel raw and uncomfortable.Does mucus color matter?While green or yellow mucus may occur in a bacterial infection, this doesn’t mean you have a bacterial infection. You can have a common cold that produces thick, discolored mucus as the virus runs its course. However, infectious sinusitis commonly causes thick greenish-yellow nasal discharge.What are the risk factors?Colds are very contagious. Young children in daycare settings are especially susceptible to colds and bacterial infections, but people of any age can develop a cold or sinus infection if exposed to the germs causing infection. Having nasal polyps (small growths in the sinuses) or other obstructions in your sinus cavity can increase your risk for sinus infections. That’s because these obstructions can lead to inflammation and poor drainage that allows bacteria to breed. You’re also at increased risk for a cold or a bacterial infection if you have a weakened immune system.When to see a doctorIf cold symptoms come and go, or are at least significantly improving, within a week, you probably don’t need to see a doctor.If your congestion, sinus pressure, and other symptoms persist, see your physician or visit an urgent care clinic. You may need medication to treat an infection.For infants under 3 months of age, a fever at or above 100.4°F (38°C) that persists for more than a day should prompt a visit to the doctor.A child of any age who has a fever that lingers for two or more days or gets progressively higher should be seen by a doctor. Earaches and uncharacteristic fussiness in a child can also suggest an infection that needs medical evaluation. Other signs of a serious viral or bacterial infection include an unusually low appetite and extreme drowsiness.If you’re an adult and have a persistent fever of above 101.3°F (38.5°C), see a doctor. This could indicate your cold has turned into a superimposed bacterial infection. Also see a healthcare provider if your breathing is compromised, meaning you’re wheezing or experiencing other symptoms of shortness of breath. A respiratory infection at any age can worsen and lead to pneumonia, which can be a life-threatening condition.Other serious sinusitis symptoms that should be evaluated by a doctor include:severe headachedouble visionstiff neckconfusionredness or swelling around the cheeks or eyes»MORE:Get an online treatment plan for your cold, flu, or sinus infection in as little as 15 minutes with Optum Perks Online Care.Optum Perks is owned by RVO Health. By clicking on this link, we may receive a commission. Learn more.How is each condition diagnosed?A common cold can usually be diagnosed with a standard physical examination and a review of symptoms. Your doctor may perform a rhinoscopy if they suspect a sinus infection.During a rhinoscopy, your doctor will insert an endoscope gently into your nose and sinus cavity so they can look at the lining of your sinuses. An endoscope is a thin tube that has a light at one end and either has a camera or an eyepiece to look through. If your doctor thinks an allergy is causing your sinus inflammation, they may recommend an allergy skin test to help identify the allergen causing your symptoms.How to treat a cold vs. a sinus infectionThere’s no medication cure or vaccine for the common cold. Instead, treatment should focus on managing symptoms. Congestion can often be relieved by using a saline spray in each nostril a couple of times a day. A nasal decongestant, such as oxymetazoline (Afrin), may also be helpful. But you shouldn’t use it for more than three days. If you have a headache, or body aches and pains, you may take acetaminophen (Tylenol) or ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) for pain relief.For a sinus infection, saline or decongestant nasal spray may help with congestion. You may also be prescribed a corticosteroid, usually in a nasal spray form. A pill form may be necessary in certain cases in order to help reduce severely inflamed sinuses.If your doctor thinks you may have a bacterial infection, you may be prescribed a course of antibiotic therapy. This should be taken exactly as prescribed and for the duration recommended by your doctor.Stopping a course of antibiotics too soon can allow an infection to linger and for symptoms to develop again.For both a sinus infection and a common cold, stay hydrated and get plenty of rest.The takeawayCold or sinus infection symptoms that linger for weeks shouldn’t be ignored. Even if they seem mild or manageable, see a healthcare provider to find out whether antibiotics or other treatments are needed. To help avoid colds or sinus infections: Limit your exposure to people who have colds, especially in confined spaces.Wash your hands frequently.Manage your allergies, either through medications or by avoiding allergens, if possible.If you frequently develop sinus infections, talk to your doctor. They can work with you to try to identify underlying causes or risk factors, which may help you reduce your risk for sinusitis in the future.",

Tips to help you quit include exercising, chewing gum, and changing your routine, among others. There are two general approaches to quitting smoking: Abrupt: This is the cold turkey method, which is when you stop using nicotine products in one shot.Gradual: This is when you slowly decrease the amount you smoke over a period of time until you quit altogether. Research is somewhat conflicting on which method is better. However, a 2021 review that included 21,542 people in England found that people who quit smoking abruptly were more likely to remain abstinent than those who quit gradually.In a 2019 meta-analysis with similar findings, the authors suggest that people who choose a gradual approach may lose motivation to quit over time. Quitting cold turkey may seem daunting and might not be the right choice for everyone. However, given the damage smoking does to your body, getting it over and done with may have its appeal.Read on to learn more about the process of quitting smoking cold turkey and tips to help you.Free support to quit smokingFor extra help or expert advice on quitting smoking:Visit Smokefree.gov.Check out Freedom from Smoking.Call 800-QUIT-NOW (800-784-8669).Prepare for symptoms of withdrawalYour body will begin to reap the health benefits of quitting smoking within 20 minutes of your last cigarette.However, you may not feel like it right away.

    "articleTextBody": "What is oregano oil?As an herbal supplement, oil of oregano is known for its antiviral, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant properties. It contains several potentially healing compounds, such as:carvacrol thymol terpinenePeople have traditionally used oil of oregano for respiratory health. It’s also become a popular alternative remedy for cold and flu symptoms.Oregano oil is used to treat cold and flu symptoms, but it can be consumed in different forms depending on your preference. It can be purchased as an herbal supplement, tincture, or essential oil.You can find it at most health food stores as a tincture or softgel capsule. You can also buy it in the form of a highly concentrated aromatic, volatile (tending to evaporate) essential oil for external use and aromatherapy.Keep reading to learn more about the research behind the benefits of oregano oil for cold and flu symptoms and how to safely use it. What does the research say?There have been several recent studies looking at the health benefits of oregano herbal oil, and most of the findings are promising.A 2017 study found that oregano essential oil, especially from the leaves of the oregano plant, has strong antioxidant properties. The researchers noted the traditional use of oregano oil in treating fevers and respiratory symptoms, which are both associated with the flu.Research conducted in 2011 found that oregano essential oil can inhibit both human and animal viruses in vitro. The researchers noted that this action is likely due to carvacrol, one of the main compounds in oregano oil. While carvacrol was more effective against certain viruses on its own, oregano oil was more effective against respiratory viruses, such as flu viruses.People with upper respiratory infections participating in a 2011 study used a throat spray containing oregano oil as well as diluted eucalyptus, peppermint, and rosemary essential oils. They used it 5 times a day for 3 days.Compared to those in the placebo group, those who used the spray had reduced symptoms of sore throat, hoarseness, and cough 20 minutes after using it. However, there wasn’t a major difference in symptoms between the 2 groups after 3 days of treatment. The researchers noted that this might be due to symptoms naturally improving in both groups during those 3 days.In addition, a small 2013 study found that oregano oil reduced pain in rats due to its analgesic effects. This suggests that oregano oil might help with more painful flu symptoms, such as body aches or a sore throat, but larger human studies are needed. Is it safe?Oregano oil is generally safe to use, but it can have some side effects.Avoid using it if you’re allergic to mint, sage, basil, or lavender. If you’re allergic to any of these, you’re likely allergic to oregano as well.Don’t use oregano oil if you’re pregnant or breastfeeding.Talk to your pediatrician before using it on a child.Don’t take oregano oil if you have a bleeding disorder or are on any medications that alter clotting of your blood.Supplements and herbs aren’t closely monitored by the FDA, and there may be issues regarding such attributes as purity, contamination, quality, and strength. Research the brand and be an informed consumer. It’s always wise to talk to your healthcare provider before using any herb, essential oil, or supplement.Even if you don’t have an allergy, taking oregano oil may cause:nauseavomitingdiarrheastomach problemsfatigueincreased bleedingmuscle painvertigoheadachedifficulty swallowingexcessive salivationinappropriate talkativenessRead more about the side effects of oregano oil and when you should see a healthcare provider. How do I use it?There are several ways to use oregano oil.If you are using the pure essential oil form, remember to never ingest essential oils. Instead, follow these steps:add a few drops to a steam diffuser or bowl of hot waterapply to your skin after adding about five drops to a carrier oil, such as coconut oilLearn more about how to use essential oils for the flu.You can also shop for an oregano oil tincture, which is an extract and essential oil blend formulated to take orally. Follow the dosage instructions on the bottle.Alternatively, you can purchase oregano herbal oil in capsule form. Carefully read the dosage instructions on the bottle.Regardless of why you’re taking oregano oil, make sure you take at least a weeklong break for every 3 weeks of use.Oregano oil is a powerful substance, so it’s best to start with the smallest possible dose to see how your body reacts. You can slowly increase the amount you take once you see how your body responds.Just make sure you don’t take more than the recommended amount listed on the package. Also keep in mind that recommended dosages can vary between manufacturers. The bottom lineOregano oil has several health benefits that are backed by research, though larger studies are needed to fully understand how it works.If you find yourself dealing with a cold or the flu, try using oregano herbal oil for relief. Just make sure you don’t go over the recommended dosage.",

    "articleTextBody": "Popping a cold sore may be tempting, but it’s generally not a good idea. It can increase the risk of infection and scarring. To speed up healing, rather use an over-the-counter cold sore cream to keep the area clean and moisturized.What is a cold sore?Cold sores, also called fever blisters, are small, fluid-filled blisters that develop on or around your lips. The blisters form in a group. But once they break and crust over, they look like one large sore.Cold sores are caused by the herpes virus HSV-1. According to the World Health Organization, more than 67 percent of people worldwide have an HSV-1 infection.Once you’ve had a herpes infection, the virus remains in the nerve cells of your face for the rest of your life. The virus can remain dormant, only causing symptoms once, or it can reactivate and cause more cold sores.Popping a cold sore can be tempting, especially when you have one that’s highly visible and uncomfortable. But popping cold sores generally isn’t a good idea.Read on to learn why and find out what you can do instead. What happens when you pop a cold sore?Left to heal on its own, a cold sore will usually disappear without leaving a scar. The blister will break, scab over, and eventually fall off.But interrupting this healing process can lead to several problems, including:More cold sores. Cold sores are highly contagious. Once the fluid from the blisters is released, it can spread the virus to other parts of your skin. This also increases your risk of passing the virus to someone else.New infections. Having an open sore gives other viruses, bacteria, and fungi an entry point, which can lead to developing another infection. Having another infection will further slow down the healing process and only make the affected area more visible.Scarring. Cold sores don’t usually scar when left alone to heal or treated with medication. But squeezing a cold sore inflames the area, make it more prone to scarring.Pain. Cold sores can be painful enough as it is. Popping one will only irritate it and make the pain worse, especially if it becomes infected.It’s especially important to not pop a cold sore if you have a compromised immune system due to an underlying condition or medical treatment.If you have a skin condition that causes cracks or wounds in your skin, such as eczema or psoriasis, you’re also at a higher risk of spreading the virus to other areas of your body. This can result in several conditions, such as herpetic whitlow and viral keratitis. What can I do instead?While it’s best not to pop a cold sore, there are other things you can do to speed up the healing process.Give these tips a try:Apply an over-the-counter (OTC) antiviral cold sore medication. If you do this at the first sign of cold sore, you may be able to help it heal faster. Cold sore creams are available without a prescription. Look for creams containing benzyl alcohol (Zilactin) or docosanol (Abreva). You can find these on Amazon.Take an OTC pain reliever. If your cold sore is painful, take an OTC pain medication, such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) or acetaminophen (Tylenol) for relief.Apply ice or a cold, wet towel. Applying an ice pack wrapped in a towel can help reduce pain and alleviate any burning or itching your cold sore might cause. It can also help to minimize redness and welling. No ice pack? A clean towel soaked in cold water will do the trick too.Moisturize. When your cold sore starts to crust over, apply a little petroleum jelly or lip balm to help reduce the appearance of flakes and cracks.Get a prescription for antiviral medication. If you regularly get cold sores, a doctor may prescribe an oral antiviral medication or antiviral ointment to help cold sores heal faster. Examples include acyclovir (Zovirax), valacyclovir (Valtrex), penciclovir (Denavir), or famciclovir (Famvir).Wash your hands. To avoid spreading your infection or contracting a secondary infection, try not to touch your cold sore. If you do touch it to apply an ointment, make sure you wash your hands afterward to avoid spreading the virus. How long will it take to heal on its own?The time it takes for a cold sore to heal varies from person to person. Generally, cold sores heal within a few days to two weeks without any treatment. If your cold sore lasts longer than 15 days or you have a compromised immune system from cancer treatment or from a medical condition, such as HIV, speak to your doctor.Learn more about the stages of a cold sore. The bottom linePopping a cold sore in hopes of getting it to heal faster can backfire, worsening your symptoms and increasing your risk of another infection or long-term scarring. You may be able to heal a cold sore faster with the help of an OTC cold sore cream and by keeping the area clean and moisturized.If you have a cold sore that doesn’t seem to be healing or keeps coming back, make an appointment with a doctor. You may need a prescription treatment.",

    "articleTextBody": "There’s no evidence that drinking cold water is bad for your health. Both cold and room-temperature water will keep you hydrated. Drinking warm water has its own benefits, such as helping digestion and toxin removal.Staying hydrated has proven benefits for your mental and physical health.The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine recommends that men 19 and older consume 3.7 liters of water per day (15.5 cups) and women 19 and older consume 2.7 liters per day (11.5 cups). But can drinking cold water have a negative impact on your health?Some people believe that drinking cold water is a bad habit that can harm your long-term health. This belief is based on the idea that drinking cold water contracts your stomach, making it harder to digest food after a meal. Some people also believe that your body has to work harder to maintain its internal temperature of 98.6°F (37°C) if you’re drinking water that’s near the temperature of ice, or less than 36°F (4°C).But is there any truth to these ideas? Keep reading to find out the possible risks and benefits of drinking cold water.RisksDrinking cold water does affect your body in ways you might not anticipate or want. An older and small study from 1978, involving 15 people, found that drinking cold water made nasal mucous thicker and more difficult to pass through the respiratory tract.By comparison, the researchers found that chicken soup and hot water helped people breathe more easily. If you’re trying to treat a cold or flu, drinking cold water might make your congestion feel worse.There are some health conditions that drinking cold water can aggravate. Research from 2001 linked drinking cold water with triggering migraine in people who already experience migraine. The pain related to achalasia, a condition that limits your body’s ability to pass food through your esophagus, can also get worse when you drink cold water with a meal, according to a 2012 study.In traditional Chinese medicine, drinking cold water with hot food is believed to create an imbalance. Typically, meals in the Chinese culture are served with warm water or hot tea, instead. This belief is mirrored in several other cultures around the world.Some people hold a similar belief that drinking cold water on a hot day won’t help cool you down. There isn’t enough research to conclude that either belief is true or false.BenefitsDrinking cold water does have benefits. According to a 2012 study, drinking cold water during exercise can help keep your body from overheating and make your workout session more successful. This is probably because drinking cold water makes it easier for your body to maintain a lower core temperature.Can drinking cold water help with weight loss?Drinking plain water, no matter the temperature, has been associated with lower calorie intake throughout the day.Drinking water as an alternative to sugary beverages is good for your digestion and maintaining a moderate weight, even if the water you drink is on the colder side.Drinking water that’s cold may help you burn a few extra calories as you digest it, because your body has to work harder to maintain its core temperature. But it’s not likely that drinking cold water is a powerful jump-start tool for weight loss.Is warm or hot water better than cold water?Drinking warm water can: help digestionaid in circulationassist the body in getting rid of toxins fasterWhile this isn’t a “risk,” per se, it’s something to keep in mind as you decide how you’d like to get water in your body.Drinking warm or hot water has been found to make you less thirsty. This can be dangerous on days when your body is trying to keep cool by losing water through sweat. If you opt to drink warm water, be aware that you may not feel thirsty as often as you should.TakeawaySome people may want to avoid drinking cold water. Drinking cold water while you have a cold or flu, or if you have any chronic condition that results in slower digestion, is probably not a great idea.But, while some cultures regard drinking cold water as a significant health risk for everyone, there isn’t a lot of research to support that claim. There are plenty of benefits to drinking warm water, though.As for the benefits of drinking cold water? They turn out to be the same benefits of drinking regular room-temperature water: keeping you hydrated and feeling refreshed.If you’re concerned about your digestion, trying to maintain a moderate weight, or feeling like you might be consistently dehydrated, speak with your doctor to make a plan.",

    "articleTextBody": "Lysine may help reduce cold sore flare-ups, but don’t use it if you’re pregnant, as there isn’t enough research to support its safety. It’s a good idea to ask your doctor before trying any treatment.Cold sores, or fever blisters, result from a viral infection. These painful, fluid-filled blisters commonly appear on or near the lips in clusters or patches. Cold sores are caused by the herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1, also known as oral herpes). HSV-1 can be spread through close contact, such as kissing.There is no cure for a cold sore infection, but this condition can be treated with common antiviral medication, such as valacyclovir (Valtrex) or acyclovir (Zovirax). A medication you might take in addition to antivirals is lysine, an essential amino acid found in protein. It isn’t produced in your body, so you must consume it through an oral supplement or diet.Common foods rich in lysine include:beefchickenturkeyporkcodfishsardineseggsyogurtparmesan cheesespirulinasoybeansLysine is essential for human health, aiding calcium absorption and collagen formation. Many people consume enough lysine in their diet. But some — athletes or vegans specifically — may need to consume more. If you don’t have enough lysine in your body, you may experience irregular symptoms, including:fatiguenauseaappetite lossagitationanemia How it worksIn order to replicate in the body, herpes simplex needs a steady source of arginine. This amino acid converts into nitric oxide within your body, a chemical necessary to expand blood vessels and improve blood flow.Lysine is thought to interfere with arginine being absorbed into your intestine, making the amino acid unavailable for the virus. So even if it may not cure a cold sore infection, lysine can help slow or prevent the HSV-1 replication process.In addition, older research suggests that lysine may reduce the number of occurrences of this infection and decrease healing time. For example, a small study from 2005 showed that lysine sped up the healing process for 87 percent of participants, shortening the average time from 21 days to 6 days for these people. Dosage for treating or preventing cold soresLysine is available as an oral supplement and a cream.To treat a cold sore infection, apply lysine cream to the affected area every two hours for 11 days.To manage cold sore infections, the recommended dosage for oral supplements is 1 gram three times daily. To help prevent them, the dosage is 1 gram daily.It’s also recommended that you take a zinc and vitamin C supplement to provide your immune system with an additional boost.If you see no improvement in your condition, discuss dosages and alternative treatment with your doctor. If you begin to experience worsening symptoms, stop treatment immediately. Lysine side effectsWhen taken at its recommended dosage, lysine is generally safe. However, it can cause a number of side effects, including:diarrheacrampsabdominal paingallstonesnauseakidney issues Pregnancy and other precautionsThere isn’t enough information about the safety or side effects of taking lysine during pregnancy. If you’re breastfeeding or pregnant, this supplement isn’t recommended. When incorporating lysine into your diet, eat foods in moderation to avoid weight gain or developing a health condition.Before taking lysine or any other supplement, discuss the risks with your doctor. Lysine can interact with other medications you may be taking. It can also increase your calcium absorption, which can in turn weaken your bones and affect organ function. Outlook for treating cold sores with lysineA cold sore infection can’t be cured, but lysine treatment can reduce its recurrence. Though shown to be effective, lysine isn’t recommended for pregnant women since there isn’t enough information on how safe it is for these women.Before pursuing treatment, discuss lysine and other alternatives with your doctor to determine the best treatment for your cold sores.",

    "articleTextBody": "Echinacea is a group of flowering plants that belong to the daisy family, along with plants like sunflowers, chicory, chamomile, and chrysanthemums.There are different species, with Echinacea purpurea being popular. Other species include Echinacea pallida, Echinacea laevigata, and Echinacea tennesseensis.The leaves and roots of the plant have long been used in traditional medicine to reduce inflammation and enhance immune function (1).It’s popular as a natural remedy to reduce cold and flu symptoms like stuffiness, sneezing, and sinus pressure. However, you may wonder whether this herb deserves a spot in your medicine cabinet and if it really does prevent and treat the common cold.This article looks at the safety and effectiveness of using echinacea to treat the common cold.Does it work?Research has turned up mixed results on echinacea’s ability to reduce symptoms of the common cold.For instance, one review of 16 studies concluded that the herb was more effective than a placebo at preventing and treating upper respiratory infections like the cold (2).Another review of 14 studies found that it reduced the odds of developing the common cold by 58% and decreased the duration of symptoms by 1.4 days (3).Similarly, in one study in 80 people, taking echinacea at the onset of cold symptoms reduced the duration of symptoms by 67%, compared with a placebo (4).In a review including nearly 2,500 people, echinacea extract was found to reduce the risk of recurrent respiratory tract infections and decrease complications like pneumonia, tonsillitis, and ear infections (5).Multiple test-tube and animal studies have also concluded that the extract may enhance immune function by increasing the production of specific immune cells in the body (6, 7, 8).Not only that, but it could also help treat symptoms of the flu.In one study in 473 people with the flu, drinking an echinacea-based beverage was as effective as an antiviral medication at treating symptoms. Yet, the study was funded by the drug manufacturer which may have affected results (9).On the other hand, a large review of 24 studies found that echinacea didn’t significantly prevent cold symptoms. However, it did find weak evidence that this herb might reduce the incidence of the common cold (10).Still, according to the review, many studies on the effectiveness of echinacea have a high risk of bias and are underpowered, meaning that the results may not be statistically significant (10).Therefore, more high-quality research is needed to determine if this herb can help treat the common cold.SummarySome studies have observed that echinacea could aid in preventing and treating the common cold, but more research is needed.Potential side effectsAlthough echinacea is generally considered safe when used as directed, it has been associated with potential side effects, including stomach pain, nausea, rash, difficulty breathing, and swelling of the skin (1).Additionally, while studies show that the herb can be used safely by women who are pregnant and breastfeeding, it should be used with caution until more high-quality human studies are available (11, 12).In children, echinacea may be associated with an increased risk of rash, which is why it’s often not recommended for use in children under 12 years of age (13, 14).Furthermore, if you have any underlying health conditions or take any medications, it’s best to consult with your healthcare provider before using echinacea.SummaryEchinacea is generally safe and associated with minimal adverse side effects. Children, people with underlying health conditions, and women who are pregnant or breastfeeding should exercise caution when using it.How to useEchinacea is widely available at health stores, pharmacies, and online in tea, tablet, and tincture form.Although there is no official recommended dosage for echinacea extract, most studies have evaluated the effects of dosages of 450–4,000 mg daily for up to 4 months (10).Many capsules and supplements contain one or two types of echinacea root and are often combined with other ingredients like vitamin C or elderberry.Echinacea tea is also available, which can contain up to 1,000 mg of the root per serving.Regardless of which form you choose, it’s best to start with a low dose and work your way up to assess your tolerance. If you notice any negative side effects, discontinue use and consult your healthcare provider. When purchasing a supplement, look for products that have been tested by an independent third party.SummaryEchinacea is found in tea, tincture, and capsule forms. Most studies have evaluated the effects of echinacea in doses of 450–4,000 mg daily for up to 4 months.The bottom lineEchinacea is a powerful herb with potent medicinal properties.Although some research has found that it might treat and prevent the common cold, other studies have concluded that it’s unlikely to have any significant impact. Hence, more high-quality studies in humans are needed.That said, echinacea is associated with minimal adverse effects on health and can be a great addition to your natural cold-fighting routine if you find it helpful.",

    "articleTextBody": "Using ice or a cold compress to treat pain and swelling is a long-held practice. Many find it effective for quick pain relief, but it may not have long-term use and overall health benefits.The idea of icing an injury to help reduce pain has been around for a long time and is often seen as a key first-aid treatment.Many people keep ice packs in their first-aid kits and home freezers, turning to them to help ease pain, swelling, and inflammation and even to stop bleeding. The cold restricts blood circulation, which many people find helps to numb pain and possibly help limit bruising.However, not all research supports the notion that cold compresses and ice treatment are better, and some researchers believe it actually slows down the physical processes that go toward your healing.Read on to learn everything about when to use a cold compress, how to make one, and for how long to use it.How to make and use your own cold compressYou can also make cold compresses with materials found right in your own home. That’s because ice can help you make a cold compress quickly, easily, and affordably.To make your own cold compress, you can use the following:ice (or frozen vegetables)washclothwaterplastic bagtowelThe processHere is how you can make a cold compress:Step 1: Place ice cubes in a plastic bag. You can also substitute ice with a bag of frozen food, like peas. It’s best to use smaller vegetables so the bag will sit well on your skin. If you do need to use a bag of frozen food, fill up ice cube trays in the meantime. That way, you have a backup when the bag of frozen food thaws out.You can also use a towel to make a cold compress if you don’t have ice:Dampen a towel with cold water and place it in a sealable plastic bag.Place the bag in the freezer for 15 minutes.Cold compresses made from wet towels may be more comfortable for sensitive areas, such as the eyes. Step 2: Run a washcloth under cold water and wrap it around the plastic bag of ice. If you don’t think it’s too cold against your skin, you can also dip the washcloth into an ice bath.Step 3: Place the homemade compress on your skin for up to 20 minutes.Step 4: After you’re done, pat the area dry with a towel. You can also dab the skin as you hold the ice pack on yourself. The ice may start melting quickly. Reapply: For swelling, reapply the compress after 2 hours. Keep doing this until the swelling goes away.How to use a cold compress for injuriesYou can find mentions of cold compresses and ice treatments in many first-aid resources.Immediately using a cold compress to treat your pain is often recommended, and many healthcare professionals advise icing your injury within the first 48 hours.A common recommendation is to avoid using cold compresses for more than 20 minutes at a time, though others also point to the benefits of 10-minute or varying increments of time.While most agree that icing and cold compresses may help ease pain in the short term, that’s not a long-term solution, and the benefits of using this type of treatment are largely unstudied.Your healthcare team can help discuss options if you continue experiencing pain for more than 48 or 72 hours, depending on your injury or situation and any possible post-care instructions they’ve given you for specific procedures where you might turn to cold compresses afterward.You may also follow these steps in the RICE method:Rest: Avoid using the injured area. Only do activities as your body allows.Ice: Put a cold compress on the area as soon as possible. This will help reduce inflammation, bleeding, and bruising.Compress: Wrap the area with a bandage. Keep an elastic bandage in your first-aid for this.Elevate: Keep the injury above your heart to reduce swelling. For example, if you’ve injured your arm or leg, lay down with your leg or arm on top of pillows.You can also take a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) such as ibuprofen or Tylenol. Taking NSAIDs while using cold compresses can help treat pain more effectively.

Injuries that aren’t life threatening may benefit from a cold compress.Ice is often seen as helping to relieve pain from:headachemuscle strainsgout painmuscle sprainstendonitisfevereye allergieshemorrhoidsCold compresses can be used on both adults and children. Be careful when using ice packs on babies, as they may not be able to tolerate such cold temperatures.Read more: Sprains vs. strains »Risks and warningsUsing cold compresses is often seen as one of the easiest and most immediate ways to treat an injury.However, there may be risks and unintended side effects if you don’t use the compress properly.Don’tsDon’t apply ice directly to the skin. It can stick to you and burn, causing further injury.Don’t ice one area for too long. This can lead to frostbite.Don’t use a cold compress for serious injuries. Your body may undergo too many changes for ice to serve any benefit.Don’t put ice on areas with decreased sensation, such as from diabetes or Raynaud’s syndrome.The bottom lineUsing ice and cold compresses to treat injuries and help reduce pain or swelling is a long-time practice that is commonly advised in sports medicine and by many healthcare professionals.While research doesn’t fully support using cold compresses or ice treatment for long-term relief, the immediate effects are tough to overlook.You can make a compress from household items, including ice, bagged frozen vegetables, or even a frozen towel. It’s also a good idea to keep cold packs in your first-aid kit in case of emergencies. Make sure to consult your healthcare team about any pain or symptoms you’re experiencing, whether from an injury or after a procedure. They can best guide you on any pain treatments or other options to help relieve pain, swelling, inflammation, and bruising.Keep reading: Treating pain with heat and cold »",

    "articleTextBody": "The common cold typically has three stages, during which you may experience different symptoms. The cold can often spread to others as long as you have active symptoms.You might think cold season is only active during the winter, but that’s not the case. According to the Mayo Clinic, though you have a higher chance of developing a cold in the fall and winter, you can get a cold anytime during the year.The CDC reports that adults have an average of two to three colds each year, while children can have even more.And while you might be familiar with the symptoms and effects of the common cold, there’s a chance you’re unaware of:how this upper respiratory virus progresseshow to treat itwhen to call the doctorWhile you can’t cure the common cold, there’s a lot to be said for prevention and self-care tips as your body works to rid itself of the virus.If you’re concerned you might be at risk of catching a cold or you currently have one, we’ve got you covered. Below, we’ve compiled an overview of everything from stages and symptoms to recovery tips. Stage 1: Days 1 to 3 (Prodrome/Early)The tickle of an impending cold is all too familiar and can cause the desperate need to down glasses of orange juice and use lots of hand sanitizer.Unfortunately, if your throat is already tingling or scratchy, it’s likely one of the 200 strains of the common cold virus — most commonly the rhinovirus — has already settled in for the next 7 to 10 days.The most common symptoms to look out for during this stage are:tingling or scratchy throatbody achestiredness or fatigueDr. Doug Nunamaker, a family practice physician and chief medical officer forAtlas MD, explains that it’s in these first days of a cold that most people don’t do enough to care for their symptoms.Though there are a number of over-the-counter (OTC) treatments and remedies that can ease the symptoms of a cold during this stage, Nunamaker also suggests reaching for one of the most common dishes for people with a cold or flu: chicken noodle soup.“It’s easy on the stomach, soothes the throat, [and] provides fluid for hydration,” he explains. If you have a fever or are sweating, he adds, chicken soup can also help replenish some of the salt your body might lose.In terms of contagion levels, Nunamaker says your cold is contagious if you present “active symptoms.” So, the tickle in your throat, runny nose, body aches, and even low-grade fever mean you’re at risk of spreading the bug to everyone around you.Recovery tipsTake decongestants and cough syrup but avoid mixing combination medications (e.g., don’t take ibuprofen separately if it’s also included in your cold medicine). Get plenty of sleep and rest.Stay hydrated.OTC Zinc supplements or lozenges have been shown to reduce the duration and severity of symptoms, when taken soon after the onset of symptoms. However, a side effect may be a bad taste or nausea. Ways to avoid spreading the cold virus while you’re still contagious:Avoid public contact if at all possible by staying home from work and school.Avoid physical contact with other people, such as kissing or shaking hands.Wash your hands often with soap and water.Fully cover your cough and sneeze in your elbow or a tissue. Immediately dispose of the tissue and wash your hands. Stage 2: Days 4 to 7 (Active/Peak)This is when the virus is at its peak intensity. You might find during this time that everything hurts, and your face feels like a running faucet. You may even experience a fever, which can be alarming. Because you have a virus, however, you have a compromised immune system. A fever, explains Nunamaker, is your body’s way of defending your immune system.“[A fever is] nature’s antibiotic. Let it ride,” he explains.Nunamaker adds that a fever isn’t a concern until it’s 102 to 103°F (39°C). In fact, up to 100.4°F (38°C), you’re considered to have an “elevated temperature,” not a fever.Fevers with a cold can be easily confused with the flu. You should remember that the flu has radically different, and far more severe symptoms, which come on hard, fast, and usually include a headache.The most common symptoms to look out for during this stage of a cold are:sore throatcoughcongestion or runny nosefatigueacheschills or low-grade feverAs was the case in stage 1, if your symptoms are still active, you’re still contagious. During this time, you should continue to be mindful about being around others and avoid physical interactions.Recovery tipsAvoid smoking, if you smoke, as it paralyzes the cilia in the lungs and takes longer to heal.Avoid asking your healthcare provider for an antibiotic. This is a viral infection and an antibiotic will not help. In fact, it could make things worse.Use a cough suppressant if you find it difficult to sleep.Take ibuprofen for body aches.Get your daily amount of vitamin C (1 to 2 grams per day) via fresh fruit or supplements.Gargle with salt water.Use a humidifier, or take a steam bath or shower.Use Chloraseptic or Cepacol lozenges. The benzocaine is a topical numbing agent and can help soothe sore throats.Continue to take zinc supplements or lozenges.While your body fights the cold virus, it’s vital to stay hydrated throughout all three stages of your cold. Stage 3: Days 8 to 10 (End/Late)A cold typically wraps up around day 10. There are, of course, exceptions. If you’re still feeling the effects, your symptoms worsen, or your fever increases then it’s time to re-evaluate and think about a different course of treatment. When should I call a doctor?While it’s tempting to call the doctor when you’re feeling crummy for a couple of days, it’s best to avoid doing so until after your symptoms have persisted for longer than 10. Call a doctor if your symptoms worsen after this time.Some people might also experience what’s known as the post-infectious cough, which is a nagging cough that can last an average of 18 days after your cold subsides. If, however, all your other symptoms have ended, you can consider yourself free and clear.If the other “active” symptoms are still present, you’re still contagious and should continue to follow the tips to prevent spreading the virus.The most common symptoms to look out for during this stage are the following:coughcongestionrunny nosefatigueRecovery tipsContinue to cover your cough with your sleeve at the elbow or with a tissue, and wash your hands.Continue taking an OTC ibuprofen, decongestant, cough suppressant, or antihistamine, as needed. OTC cold remediesHere’s a list of cold remedies you can buy now:ibuprofenChloraseptic or Cepacol lozengesOTC zinc supplements or lozengesdecongestantscough syrupvitamin CantihistamineYou can also shop online for humidifiers and hand sanitizers.Be sure to talk to your healthcare provider before adding any treatment options to your current healthcare regimen to avoid any potential negative interactions. The takeawayWhen it comes to a cold, you’ve got to accept that it’s happening and ride it out. The very best thing you can do is take actions to prevent a cold by:washing your hands frequently with soap and wateravoiding any unnecessary physical contact where you could contract the virusstaying hydrated and well-restedFinally, be mindful of how your health affects other people, especially those with compromised immune systems, and stay home when you’re contagious.Brandi Koskie is the founder of Banter Strategy, where she serves as a content strategist and health journalist for dynamic clients.

    "articleTextBody": "Anxiety affects everyone in different ways. Sometimes, the feelings of fear and dread don’t go away or get worse over time. Here, you can learn about anxiety, who it affects, and how to manage it. What is anxiety?Anxiety is your body’s natural response to stress. It’s a feeling of fear or apprehension about what’s to come. For example, going to a job interview or giving a speech on the first day of school may cause some people to feel fearful and nervous.But if your feelings of anxiety are extreme, last for at least 6 months, and are interfering with your life, you may have an anxiety disorder.What are anxiety disorders?It’s normal to feel anxious about moving to a new place, starting a new job, or taking a test. This type of anxiety is unpleasant, but it may motivate you to work harder and do a better job. Ordinary anxiety is a feeling that comes and goes but doesn’t interfere with your everyday life.In the case of an anxiety disorder, the feeling of fear may be with you all the time. It’s intense and sometimes debilitating.This type of anxiety may cause you to stop doing things you enjoy. For example, it may prevent you from entering an elevator, crossing the street, or even leaving your home in extreme cases. If left untreated, the anxiety will keep getting worse.Anxiety disorders are the most common form of emotional disorder and can affect anyone. But, according to the American Psychiatric Association, women are more likely than men to receive a diagnosis of an anxiety disorder.What are the types of anxiety disorders?Anxiety is a vital part of several different disorders. These include:Panic disorder. This means you experience recurring panic attacks at unexpected times.Phobia. This is an excessive fear of a specific object, situation, or activity.Social anxiety disorder. This is an extreme fear of being judged by others in social situations.Obsessive-compulsive disorder. This means you have recurring irrational thoughts that lead you to perform specific, repeated behaviors.Separation anxiety disorder. This means you have a fear of being away from home or your loved ones.Illness anxiety disorder. This is anxiety about your health (formerly called hypochondria).In addition, a number of mental health and medical conditions may feature anxiety as a symptom. These include:Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). This is anxiety following a traumatic event.Major depressive disorders. A strong relationship exists between depression and anxiety.Chronic disease. Managing conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and diabetes may result in anxiety symptoms.Inflammatory conditions. Anxiety can lead to chronic inflammation and diseases such as arthritisSubstance use disorders: many people with anxiety may try to self-medicate to help manage their symptoms.Chronic pain. Anxiety is often found in those with chronic pain disorders.What are the symptoms of anxiety?Anxiety feels different depending on the person experiencing it. Feelings can range from butterflies in your stomach to a racing heart.

The initial trigger of the fear can be known or unknown. The physical symptoms can mimic a heart attack. Once you’re experiencing a panic attack, the symptoms may get worse if you believe you may be having a heart attack or having a mental health emergency. Another common fear that may exacerbate a panic attack is the fear that you might be judged negatively if you’re having an attack in public.Panic attacks can vary greatly, and symptoms may differ among individuals. In addition, the many symptoms of anxiety don’t happen to everyone, and they can change over time.Common symptoms of a panic attack include:chest painfeeling of chokingfear of losing controlfeeling of impending doomsweating, chills, and hot flashesshakingnumbness and tingling of hands, feet, or facenausea or upset stomachshortness of breathfear of dyingWhen you experience repeated panic or anxiety attacks, you may have a panic disorder.What causes anxiety?Experts aren’t sure of the exact cause of anxiety.

Thyroid problems and other health conditions can make you prone to anxiety.Stimulants. Consuming caffeine, specific substances, and medications can worsen your symptoms.Are there tests that diagnose anxiety?A single test can’t diagnose anxiety.

Likewise, worsening symptoms of depression can become triggered by an anxiety disorder.You can manage symptoms of both conditions with many of the same treatments: psychotherapy (counseling), medications, and lifestyle changes.How to help children with anxietyAnxiety in children is natural and expected. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 10% of children and adolescents ages 3 to 17 have had a diagnosis of anxiety.As children grow up, they should outgrow the worries and fears they felt when they were younger. It may be considered an anxiety disorder if they’re afraid to be away from their parents, exhibit extreme fear, and other anxiety symptoms that interfere with their day-to-day lives.Anxiety in children can also become chronic and persistent, with uncontrolled anxiety leading them to avoid interacting with their peers or family members.Symptoms of an anxiety disorder in children might include:angerirritabilitytrouble sleepingfeelings of fearfatigueheadachesstomachachesAnxiety treatment for children includes cognitive behavioral therapy (talk therapy) and medications.»MORE: Learn more about the symptoms of an anxiety disorder and techniques to help calm your child's anxiety.How to help teens with anxietyTeenagers may have many reasons to be anxious. Tests, college visits, and first dates all pop up in these important years. But teenagers who feel anxious or experience anxiety symptoms frequently may have an anxiety disorder.Symptoms of anxiety in teenagers may include nervousness, shyness, isolationist behaviors, and avoidance. Likewise, anxiety in teens may lead to unusual behaviors.For example, they may act out, perform poorly in school, skip social events, and even engage in substance or alcohol use.In some teens, depression may accompany anxiety. Diagnosing both conditions is essential so that their treatment can address the underlying issues and help relieve symptoms.The most common treatments for anxiety in teenagers are talk therapy and medication. These treatments also help address depression symptoms.Anxiety and stressStress and anxiety are related but different. Stress is a typical and healthy reaction to an identifiable event that’s making you nervous, such as an upcoming test, presentation, wedding, or other major change in your life.Stress will go away once the trigger goes away. Anxiety, on the other hand, persists beyond any trigger and may exist without a known trigger. A person may need treatment for anxiety to go away.Both anxiety and stress respond well to physical activity, good sleep hygiene, and a well-balanced diet. But if your anxiety and stress don’t respond well and you feel your day-to-day functioning is impaired, a mental health professional can help you determine a treatment plan.Physical symptoms of anxietyWhen you experience symptoms of anxiety, they can manifest as physical symptoms such as:dizzinesstirednessheart palpitationsmuscle aches and tensionsshakingdry mouthexcessive sweatingstomachacheheadacheinsomniaNeither stress nor anxiety is always bad.

But chronic or long-term use can ultimately worsen the condition.»MORE: Read more to understand how alcohol can worsen anxiety symptoms.Can foods treat anxiety?Doctors commonly use medication and talk therapy to treat anxiety. But lifestyle changes, such as getting enough sleep and regular exercise, can also help.

This is important especially because children and teens may not find it so easy to talk about their feelings or be aware of their anxiety.AdultsThere are many ways to prevent anxiety and its symptoms. Please see the below options:Avoidance. Avoiding people, places, and situations can lessen your stress and anxiety. But this would be a short-term strategy. In the long term, it’s better if you get treatment so you no longer need to avoid a trigger.Stress management and mindfulness. Practicing stress management and mindfulness prevents strain.Restrict caffeine. Caffeine can worsen anxiety symptoms.Support groups. Speaking with others is an opportunity to share coping strategies and experiences.Therapy. Speaking with a therapist can help you develop more effective ways to cope with fears and stress that lead to anxiety.Speak with a doctor about your medications. Regularly speaking with a doctor about your medications’ dosing, effectiveness, and side effects ensures any health condition is treated adequately and monitored for any possible anxiety-related side effects.OutlookYou can treat your anxiety with medication, psychotherapy, or a combination of the two.But some people who have a mild anxiety disorder, or a fear of something they can easily avoid, decide to live with the condition and don’t get treatment.Avoiding the trigger, however, can actually make anxiety worse in the long term. Treatment can help you overcome the need to avoid a trigger.It’s important to understand that anxiety disorders can be treated, even in severe cases. Although anxiety usually doesn’t go away, you can learn to manage it and live a happy, healthy life.Read this article in Spanish.",

    "articleTextBody": "St. John’s wort is a plant that is used in supplements reported to help alleviate symptoms of depression. Some people use it to help relieve anxiety as well. While it’s possible that St. John’s wort could reduce anxiety, researchers haven’t proven this yet,An estimated 18.1 percent of Americans have anxiety disorder. Yet, only 36.9 percent currently receive treatment, according to the Anxiety and Depression Association of America.Anxiety facts and statistics. (n.d.). https://adaa.org/about-adaa/press-room/facts-statisticsWomen are twice as likely as men to experience anxiety. The condition can cause abnormal fear, depression, or worry. While medications exist for anxiety, some people choose to supplement these with herbs such as St. John’s wort. What is St. John’s wort?St. John’s wort or Hypericum perforatum is a wild-growing plant with yellow flowers. According to the National Institutes of Health, it’s one of the top-selling supplements in the United States.Questions and answers: A trial of St. John’s wort (hypericum perforated) for the treatment of major depression. (2018). https://nccih.nih.gov/news/2002/stjohnswort/q-and-a.htm People take the herbal supplement to help with depression, anxiety, or sleeping problems.Supplement manufacturers make St. John’s wort in different forms, including capsules, tea, or liquid extract.St. John’s wort and treating anxiety A lot of the research surrounding St. John’s wort is for its use in treating depression. However, depression and anxiety are closely linked. An estimated 50 percent of people with depression also suffer from some form of anxiety disorder, according to the Anxiety and Depression Association of America.Anxiety facts and statistics. (n.d.). https://adaa.org/about-adaa/press-room/facts-statisticsSt. John’s wort is thought to work by keeping the brain from using up neurotransmitters like serotonin, dopamine, GABA, and norepinephrine. As a result, the neurotransmitters are more effectively used in the brain. This can have an antidepressant and overall feel-good effect in the brain. As a result, a person could experience fewer bouts of anxiety. Anxiety medications, such as benzodiazepines (including Xanax and Ativan), work on GABA transmitters in the brain. Therefore, many researchers believe that St. John’s wort could have anxiety-relieving effects due to its effects on GABA transmitters. St. John’s wort is perhaps best known in its treatment for mild-to-moderate depression. A 2017 meta-analysis of 27 clinical trials published in the Journal of Affective Disorders concluded that St. John’s wort had a similar level of effectiveness as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) in treating mild-to-moderate depression.Ng X, et al. (2017). Clinical use of Hypericum perforatum (St. John’s wort) in depression: A meta-analysis. DOI: 10.1016/j.jad.2016.12.048The researchers noted the studies were all short-term, ranging from 4- to 12-weeks in length. Therefore, less is known about how effective St. John’s wort is long-term, compared to antidepressant medications. Some people prefer to take St. John’s wort over antidepressants because it typically causes fewer side effects. Dosages differed between studies. Participants in one study from the National Institutes of Health regarding depression, took an average of 1,300 milligrams of St. John’s wort per day.Questions and answers: A trial of St. John’s wort (hypericum perforated) for the treatment of major depression. (2018). https://nccih.nih.gov/news/2002/stjohnswort/q-and-a.htm The highest dose participants took was 1,800 milligrams, while the starting dose was usually 900 milligrams per day, with people taking 300 milligrams 3 times a day.Unfortunately, there aren’t many long-term human studies related specifically to anxiety and St. John’s wort. A lot of the connections made between St. John’s wort and treating anxiety are because doctors know the effects St. John’s wort has on the brain. Most of these connections, however, are theoretical.More human studies are needed but a 2017 study on rats showed that St. John’s wort reversed anxiety and depression in rats and improved their response to stress.Rojas-Carvajal M, et al. (2017). Sub-chronic administration of St. John’s wort reverses anxiety- and depressive-like behaviors induced by two different protocols of chronic stress.http://www.medigraphic.com/cgi-bin/new/resumenI.cgi?IDARTICULO=74492 A 2019 small human study of 48 people, found that taking St. John’s wort helped them respond more positively to negative signals. They also found that St. John’s wort did not change memory function.Warren MB, et al. (2018). Subchronic treatment with St John’s wort produces a positive shift in emotional processing in healthy volunteers. DOI: 10.1177/0269881118812101A smaller study from 2008 published in the journal Human Psychopharmacology: Clinical and Experimental found that taking St. John’s wort didn’t help reduce anxiety.Sarris J, et al. (2008). St. John’s wort and kava in treating major depressive disorder with co-morbid anxiety: A randomised double-blind placebo-controlled pilot trial. DOI: 10.1002/hup.994The 2008 study asked 28 adults with depression and anxiety to take either a placebo or St. John’s wort and the herb kava. At the study’s conclusion, the participants reported improvements in depression symptoms, but not anxiety. Other possible usesIn addition to its use for depression, people use St. John’s wort for other issues, including:attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)irritable bowel syndrome obsessive-compulsive disorder fatigue reduction in people receiving chemotherapy or radiation for cancer tobacco dependenceHowever, the beneficial effects of taking St. John’s wort for these uses are largely rumored. Few have been widely studied. St. John’s wort as an anxiety trigger While several studies and personal reports have found that St. John’s wort can help those with anxiety, it may have the opposite effect in some people. A case study published in the journal The Primary Care Companion for CNS Disorders reported that a patient who drank a glass of St. John’s wort extract experienced a panic attack shortly afterward.Yildirim O, et al. (2013). A case of panic attack induced by St. John’s wort. DOI: 10.4088/PCC.12l01453 The study noted the report was one of the first to suggest that St. John’s wort could cause a panic attack. St. John’s wort and drug interactionsSt. John’s wort can cause side effects as well as interact with certain medications. Potential side effects can include:dizziness dry mouthfatigue sensitivity to sunlight stomach upset Makes some drugs less effectiveSt. John’s wort also induces the metabolization of certain medications. This means the body breaks them down faster than usual so they may not work as effectively. For this reason, doctors don’t usually recommend taking St. John’s wort if a person takes medications such as:indinavir (used to treat HIV)cyclosporine (used to prevent organ transplant rejection)birth control pillsIf you take St. John’s wort (or other supplements), make sure to tell your doctor and pharmacist. Your doctor can make sure St. John’s wort won’t interfere with the medications you take currently. Serotonin syndromeIf you take St. John’s wort with other medicines that affect neurotransmitter levels, it’s possible you could experience something called serotonin syndrome. This condition causes symptoms such as agitation, tremors, sweating, and diarrhea. This can happen when you take antidepressants with St. John’s wort. As a result, it’s ESSENTIAL you talk to your doctor about all the medications you’re taking before you try this herb.In addition, always choose high-quality, regulated products from licensed manufacturers to avoid issues with consistency, strength, and contaminants.Booker A. (2018). St John’s wort (Hypericum perforatum) products – an assessment of their authenticity and quality. 10.1016/j.phymed.2017.12.012The takeawaySt. John’s wort is likely to help those who experience mild-to-moderate depression symptoms. Some people with those symptoms may also have anxiety. It’s possible that St. John’s wort could reduce anxiety when a person takes it, but researchers haven’t proven this to be true. Discontinue use if you experience an anxiety episode. Also, if you’re considering trying St. John’s wort, talk with your doctor. They can make sure it won’t interfere with other medications you’re currently taking.",

    "articleTextBody": "Amanda Mustard/Getty ImagesIt’s the night of your big game. You’ve trained and practiced for months, and now everyone — your coach, your team, your audience — is watching you. A win or a loss could come down to a single, split-second reflex. Your heart starts racing, and you can’t stop thinking about how everyone will react if you choke.Sports performance anxiety, also called sports anxiety or competitive anxiety, is incredibly common. Estimates suggest anywhere from 30 to 60 percent of athletes experience it, according to a 2019 review.Of course, knowing you’re in good company might come as cold comfort when trying to move past those overwhelming feelings of nervousness and tension.But we’ve got some good news: You can take steps to handle and even prevent sports anxiety. What’s more, knowing why it happens can make a difference.Read on to get the details on sports performance anxiety, along with a few tips to overcome it so you can get your head back where you want it — in the game.What are the signs?Researchers often divide the signs of sports performance anxiety into mental and physical categories.Common physical signs of sports anxiety include:Tremors. Maybe your hands shake when you’re holding a tennis racket, or your foot twitches when you need to stand still.Racing heart. Hormones like adrenaline and cortisol can make your heart beat faster.Hyperventilation. You might feel as if you’re choking or can’t catch your breath.Muscle tension. Your muscles may feel so tight they become painful, and you might also notice tension and pain in your head.Bathroom troubles. When you go into fight-or-flight mode, your body may rush through digestion so it can focus all its resources on survival. You might notice cramping and a sudden, strong urge to visit the toilet.Common mental signs of sports anxiety include:Intense fear of failure. When you imagine losing, your mind may leap to the worst-case scenario. You might worry about letting your team down or others laughing at you.Disrupted focus. You might have trouble concentrating on the game, instead getting absorbed in how others react to your performance.Overthinking. You may temporarily “forget” how to do actions you used to do automatically, like swinging a baseball bat or catching a ball.Reduced self-confidence. You could start doubting your abilities and wonder whether you can really win.Sports anxiety can eventually lead to:Self-sabotage. You may unconsciously set yourself up to fail by skipping breakfast or going to bed late the night before. Self-sabotage, in short, provides an “excuse” for a bad performance so you don’t lose face. Of course, a lack of preparation can also worsen your anxiety.Lashing out. Sometimes people express their worries through anger, shouting at teammates, or getting physical with opponents. According to a 2019 report, this is especially likely if your coach yells at you a lot.Poor performance. If you feel distracted and discouraged, chances are you won’t bring your A-game to the competition.What causes sports performance anxiety?Experts have come up with a few theories around why sports performance anxiety happens. Two of the most common ones include:Yerkes-Dodson lawThe Yerkes-Dodson law explains how stress and anxiety can affect performance. In a nutshell, your performance will likely suffer if your arousal levels are too low or too high. Your stress levels need to stay in a limited range in order for you to perform well.Low arousal. This means you find the sport boring, so you might not put forth your full effort.Optimal arousal. This means you feel engaged enough in the sport to push yourself a bit harder than usual.High arousal. This means the sport feels so stressful you may panic or freeze as a result. In this situation, you might experience sports anxiety.This law can apply to any kind of performing task, from a stage rehearsal to a boxing match.Keep in mind: Everyone has a different ideal level of stress. A match your teammate finds boring could feel overwhelming for you, in other words.Smith and Smoll modelThe Smith and Smoll model, first suggested in 1990, offered one of the first multidimensional models of sports performance anxiety.According to this model, multiple dimensions of anxiety can feed into one another.First, the mental element. You may anticipate how tough your upcoming match will be and wonder whether you can win. You could also start worrying about any consequences of losing.Next, the physical symptoms. As you become more anxious, your body’s fight-or-flight response might kick in. This response can lead to physical symptoms like sweating and shaking.Then, the in-the-moment impact. Physical and mental anxiety symptoms could easily distract you from the game and affect your ability to play. As your performance declines, you may feel increasingly worried. Anxiety about losing, then, can become a self-fulfilling prophecy.Are certain people more likely to experience it?Sports anxiety may affect some people more than others. You might have a higher chance of experiencing other types of anxiety if you already live with an anxiety disorder, for example.Other potential risk factors include:Being an athlete. If doing well at sports makes up a big part of your identity, then a loss could serve a large blow to your self-esteem. After all, the outcome of a game may matter more to you than to someone who plays for fun.Age. A 2018 review of 59 studies found adolescent competitors are more likely to have sports anxiety than adults. They also tend to experience physical symptoms more often.Experience. Someone attending their first competition may have a higher chance of experiencing sports anxiety than a longtime competitor. The level of competition, on the other hand, doesn’t seem to play a part. In other words, junior varsity players are just as likely to experience it as college players.Gender. A 2019 review found that girls tend to report sports anxiety more frequently, though experts aren’t entirely sure why. Girls might have a higher risk of anxiety in general, or they could simply face less stigma around expressing emotions.Even if you don’t identify with any of these traits, you can still have sports performance anxiety. Certain factors can increase the risk for anyone:An important game. Big games often yield big rewards. A finals match could win you a medal, prize money, or even a scholarship. This can create a lot of pressure.Social expectations. When a whole stadium comes to watch you play, it’s easy to feel like a single game will make or break your reputation. This is especially true in communities that consider sports a big deal.Helicopter parents. In child sports, parents can contribute to plenty of anxiety.It can feel mortifying to witness your parent screaming at the referee every time the opposing team scores. Even if your parent behaves well in public, you may worry about them criticizing your performance in private.Past failure. If you’ve messed up in the past, those mistakes could loom large in your head. You might feel obligated to “redeem” yourself with a better performance this time around.Solo competition. When you compete by yourself, you don’t have any teammates to cover for your mistakes. Victory depends on you and you alone.How to handle itYou can take a few different steps to navigate sports anxiety, both in the moment and ahead of the event.Positive self-talkSelf-talk is exactly what it sounds like: a conversation you have with yourself.Saying things like “I’m not prepared at all” or “I’m doomed to lose,” can easily derail your mood, not to mention your self-confidence. But you can consciously stop those thoughts and replace them with more encouraging messages, such as “Let’s do what I practiced” or “I can play a great game and win this.”A 2019 study on 117 junior athletes found self-talk can help athletes in a wide variety of sports. Athletes who practiced positive self-talk tended to notice:more self-confidencefewer physical anxiety symptomsimproved athletic performanceMusicWhen you feel anxious before a big match, consider putting in some earbuds and listening to some calming tunes. Music can help reduce anxiety for athletes and nonathletes alike.Studies disagree on whether the kind of music makes a difference.A small 2014 study involving college students found that while music did reduce competitive anxiety, the responses to relaxing and nonrelaxing music were similar.A small 2017 study involving elite shooters had opposite results. Music that participants rated as relaxing lowered their physical arousal. Nonrelaxing music increased arousal.Part of the difference in results may relate, in part, to how each study measured anxiety. The 2014 study mostly measured subjective anxiety through questionnaires, while the 2017 study considered physical anxiety responses.MeditationResearch suggests meditation can decrease sports anxiety.When it comes to meditation, you have plenty of types to choose from. One quick method you can try right now is focused attention meditation.To give it a try:Grab a nearby object. This can be anything, even a sock.Focus your entire mind on the sock. Examine the color, texture, even its smell (if you’re brave enough).Aim to keep your attention on the sock and the sock alone. This might prove more challenging than it sounds, since anxious minds can easily wander.If you catch your thoughts drifting, don’t give yourself a hard time. Just gently shift your thoughts back to the sock.When your mind tries to jump ahead into an anxious future, this approach can help reset your focus and return your mind to a calm present. To put it another way: Where worries once flooded your mind, now there is only sock.A 2017 study suggests focused attention meditation can be especially helpful if you compete in solo sports without time pressure, like gymnastics or archery. That said, you may want to do your meditation before the big match, rather than trying to meditate and compete at the same time.Don’t forget about your physical needsWhile feeling hungry and thirsty may not directly trigger anxiety, a connection does exist between mind and body wellness.Staying hydrated and eating nutritious meals and snacks before and during intense physical activity can go a long way toward helping you feel at your emotional and physical best.Evidence suggests, in fact, that drinking water voluntarily (whenever you feel like it, in other words) may promote improved performance during exercise.In short, filling up that water bottle and keeping it close at hand can only help.Professional supportPlenty of people feel anxious now and then, but extreme sports anxiety can eventually have a negative impact on your mental health without treatment.It’s generally time to consider professional support if:You begin to have panic attacks, which can involve more extreme symptoms like muscle weakness and chest pain.Your heart rate stays high even during rest.You start noticing sudden, frequent changes in mood.You find yourself wishing you would get seriously injured or sick so you don’t have to play anymore.Remember, therapy is confidential, so you don’t have to tell your coach or teammates about getting support unless you want to. It never hurts to open up about what you find helpful, though.Many therapists offer specialized support in sports psychology, so support is out there. To get started, you might try doing a Google search or visiting a therapist directory to search for professionals with training in sports psychology.Get more tips on finding the right therapist.The bottom lineSports performance anxiety is incredibly common, even among elite athletes. When your emotions run high enough, your performance may take a hit.Worried about making a major mistake during a game? It can help to try the relaxation techniques above. If your anxiety doesn’t improve and begins to affect your performance, a trained therapist can offer more personalized guidance and coping support.Emily Swaim is a freelance health writer and editor who specializes in psychology.

    "articleTextBody": "Images courtesy of Breanna Mona; Design by Jackie CruzComing down from the holiday season can be challenging. The burnt-out, sluggish feeling, or even anxiety that can come with the new year’s dawn can sometimes be quite hard to cope with.That’s why setting healthy resolutions and putting aside more time for mental health is especially important.Creating space for inner well-being doesn’t have to mean clearing your calendar and booking an island vacation (although if you can, why not?). It can start with something as simple as breathing exercises that only take a few minutes, if that. Studies show that breathing exercises may help reduce stress levels, lower heart rates, improve cognitive function, and help with anxiety.If you’ve tried breathing exercises before but feel like you could use some help, there’s a device for that.Moonbird is a handheld gadget created to act like a breathing coach, so you can follow its rhythm and feel less anxious and more centered anywhere you are. We tried it out for ourselves and are here to give you a full, honest review. Keep reading to see if it sounds like moonbird may help you manage stress better in the new year.What is moonbird?Moonbird is a newer device from a Belgium-founded start-up of the same name. The handheld breathing coach is a soft little device that “breathes” to encourage you to match your breathing to its calming rhythm. Holding moonbird in your hand, you sync your breathing to the device as it contracts and expands (inhale when it inhales, exhale when it exhales). The idea behind moonbird is to encourage users to pay conscious attention to their breathing through breathwork, keeping it nice and slow, to promote relaxation and better sleep. Moonbird pros and consProscan help users focus on intentional breathing may help lower anxiety and ease stress levels comes with a carrying pouch and charging cableeasy to travel withcomes with simple directions free app includes many breathing exercises don’t have to use the compatible app to operate itcan test it for free for 30 days Conspricey material may feel too slippery for someonly available in one size company ships only to the European Union, United Kingdom, and United States (does not currently ship to Switzerland, Canada, or Asia-Pacific) Get started now with MoonbirdHow it worksCEO and founder of moonbird, Stefanie Broes, is a breathwork practitioner who holds a doctorate in pharmaceutical sciences. Broes says she used to experience insomnia and launched her company to get people to practice slower breathing after noticing how it helped her sleep better. Why slower breathing? When you’re stressed or anxious, your heart rate and blood pressure increase, and your breathing quickens. This is known as the fight or flight response. Intentionally slowing your breathing can help bring things back down to a healthy level. A 2020 review on diaphragmatic breathing (DB) (slow, deep breathing) found that though it still needs more investigating, DB may help improve certain health conditions like stress and anxiety. Additionally, a small 2022 pilot study looked at how mobile tactile breathing devices — moonbird specifically — may help sleep quality. The study’s 39 participants tested the device for 1 month, and researchers found that it was “an acceptable solution for sleep problems and participants particularly appreciate the standalone function and design.” Though it seems some participants reported mentions of the size of the device (it currently only comes in one size).Using moonbirdOne of my favorite parts about using moonbird is how easy it is to operate. You “wake it” by giving it a gentle shake — there is no power button. To use it quickly without opening the app, you place your thumb on the sensor (you’ll see a green light indicating where to place your thumb). You don’t need to press hard; just hold it gently in your hand with the thumb in its proper placement over the green light. Moonbird will recognize you’re holding it and begin inflating and deflating, like a tiny set of lungs. Once it begins “breathing,” you start to pair your own breathing to its pace. Once it stops, you’ve completed one session. You can choose to finish your session or begin again if you’d like more time. Or, you can open the app for free guided sessions for different exercises (we get into more details on using the app in a minute).PricingOne of my biggest criticisms about this device is that, at its $199 price point, it’s not exactly accessible. Right now, it’s available in just one size and four colors, none of which affect pricing. The good news is that you can test the product for 30 days free of charge, with free delivery, tracking, and a money-back guarantee. This way, you’re not committed if it’s not the right device for you. Returns and exchangesMoonbird states on its website that you have 30 days to return your moonbird if you’re not happy with it. You simply email the company (hello@moonbird.life) and inform them about your return. From here, the company will send you a return shipping label. The device you’re returning has to appear exactly as it was delivered to you — no damage and in its original packaging. The company also requires that you include your receipt, order number, or proof of purchase with a date. After the company has received your return, they will notify you. Although the return policy states that customers have 30 days to return their device, it has some unclear language about needing to contact the company 14 days after you’ve received your device. The company says approved refunds will be credited back to the original payment method within 30 calendar days. My experienceI enjoy using moonbird to calm my mind. I have found it useful for taking a breather (literally) and think its pros outweigh its cons. Keep reading to see my full experience using moonbird. What it looks likeMoonbird looks like a sleek and silky remote but without any buttons. Instead, there is a censor you place your thumb over when you’re ready to use it. Although it doesn’t exactly look like a bird, the experience may remind you of holding a bird, with its size and rhythm. The moonbird “skin” is made from biocompatible, medical-grade silicone. The device uses a lithium-ion battery and an optical reflectance PPG sensor, which the company says is used to measure heart rate and derivatives. You can view this information using the moonbird app. My device is black but is also available in a teal color, light blue, and off-white color. I wouldn’t recommend the off-white color since you’ll be holding your device, and the lighter color is likely to become dingey over time. Your device will come with a carrying pouch (my pouch is blue, I don’t know if other colors are available). I suggest keeping your moonbird in the pouch when not in use so you can keep it safe from dust. I admittedly left mine out on my nightstand and noticed the material can become dusty or linty. This may be because black can show dust perhaps easier than other color options. Your moonbird will also come with a charging cable (micro USB). You can use this cable to charge it via your computer or a wall charger if you have one handy. It’s important to keep a close eye on this cord — it connects to your device via little magnets, and it’s unlikely you can find a replaceable cable for it in stores. I will say that in my experience using this device, the battery life is impressive and wasn’t a concern for me. I like using it, knowing I don’t have to worry about it quitting on me out of nowhere. Your free moonbird app, which connects to your device via Bluetooth, will show you precise information on battery life. Otherwise, you won’t know by looking at the device if it needs to be charged or not. The brand says that charging takes about 3 hours to complete. Speaking of the app, it’s optional. I like that the device doesn’t alienate users who’d rather unplug (literally) and focus on their breathing without looking at their phone. I also like that using all the app’s features doesn’t require additional purchases. For those who’d like to tinker with the app, there are endless options to explore. Using the appYou’ll connect your moonbird to your smartphone via Bluetooth to use the app. Your device will have instructions for pairing, but it’s relatively simple. The process may vary depending on your phone, but you’ll need to first download the app for Android or Apple.Next, turn on Bluetooth on your phone, gently shake your moonbird awake, and open the app. The app will “search” for your device and should sync to it pretty quickly.Once your moonbird pairs to your phone, you’ll scroll through all the breathing exercises available on the app. You’ll see options like:a breathing breakfalling asleepbox breathingcurb anxietyset your own breathing rhythmOnce you make your selection, you’ll have the option to “check in” before the exercise begins. This step is optional, but it is designed to help you track your mood before and after you perform the breathing exercises. The app automatically begins exercises with guided audio walking you through each step, but if you prefer, you can mute the audio. I found the audio to be an extra calming touch worth listening to, especially if you’re using moonbird to curb anxiety or help you fall asleep. The app also includes a guide with “episodes” to help you learn more about breathing exercises. Plus, using the app, you can view your heart rate and rate variability in real-time. Finally, you can view your stats, which show weekly, monthly, and yearly information about your completed sessions. I personally haven’t used this feature much. I’m more interested in using moonbird as a quick way to redirect my focus to my breathing rather than charting my progress, but many may find this information useful and encouraging.First impressionI was pleasantly surprised when I unboxed my moonbird. The packaging seems designed with calmness and simplicity in mind. The box is well organized with its components, and the easy-to-understand directions are a big plus. Your moonbird will probably be ready for your first session upon unboxing it like mine was, but if not, you’ll need to charge it using the cable it comes with. A little menu shows you in just three steps how to quickly operate your device (for those not using the app). Then an accompanying booklet gives more information about using it with the app. When you’re not using it along with the app, the device is so simple that you may wonder if you’re using it right at first. I had that moment at first but noticed that its ease of use is part of its appeal. After all, if you’re looking to unwind or calm down, you’d rather it be easy and intuitive. My first time using the moonbird was a test run — I wasn’t particularly stressed or anxious; I just wanted to see how it worked. My true first session came later on when I noticed I could use a break during my hectic day. Holding moonbird, closing my eyes, I felt calmer in probably just a minute or so. I think holding the device as I shifted all my focus to my breath forced my mind to shut out distractions. With calmer, deliberate breathing came a calmer state of mind. Final reviewMoonbird is different from many anxiety-relief options because it’s a physical device that can pair with free guided breathing exercises. While there’s an abundance of meditation apps designed to help calm your mind and focus on breathing, they don’t have a physical component.Holding an object, especially one performing the task you’re setting aside time to do, makes your session feel official.As someone with smaller hands, I wish the device came in different sizes. I like that it’s ergonomically designed, but the soft silicone material makes the device feel slippery. Initially, this aspect was a little distracting for me, not knowing if it would slip out of my hands as I used it lying down. A little grip somewhere on the device would help.I’ve already mentioned price as a significant downside to moonbird, but it’s worth repeating. But if you consider the costs you’re saving by not subscribing to a pricey meditation app, meditation classes, breathwork classes, etc., a one-time cost may feel worth it. Plus, moonbird allows you to access information about your heart rate, and I like that it’s convenient to use it silently without the app, and that you can easily travel with it. It’s low maintenance and has a mighty battery life. I plan to use moonbird to get calm in a hurry next time I feel overwhelmed.Is moonbird right for me?If moonbird is within your budget, and you’ve noticed that slow breathing has helped you enter a calm state before (but feel you can benefit from a physical device that helps you get there), moonbird may be a good idea for you. Since intentional breathwork can be tricky to master and make time for on your own, this device aims to help you get into a calmer state by breathing with you. Moonbird can help you perform breathwork exercises both with and without an app. The app gives you access to free guided meditations and more. While this device is best suited for someone who experiences anxiety or could use some help falling asleep, it’s not a replacement for mental health treatment by a professional. A healthcare professional can help you decide the best way to manage anxiety, and may help you find the cause behind trouble sleeping. For those who’d rather save some money, it still may be worth learning more about slower, intentional breathing as a form of meditation. Some meditation apps require a fee to use, but you can also browse guided breathwork videos on YouTube or get books from the library to learn more about it. Get started now with MoonbirdReviews and reputation of moonbirdMoonbird is still a new device, so you won’t find tons of customer reviews on it just yet. For example, at the time of writing, moonbird doesn’t seem to have any Google reviews, but it does have a profile on TrustPilot, a third-party review site.This profile shows a total of 16 reviews currently, with a rating of 4.3 out of 5 stars. Here, reviewers mention how the gadget helps them relax and get better sleep. The only poor review, written in Dutch, expresses that their moonbird did not work, and they were disappointed with the wait time to receive a new device. Right now, the company doesn’t seem to have any lawsuits or a profile with the Better Business Bureau. It’s worth mentioning that the company has plenty of mentions and editorial reviews from a good range of global publications. Reviews on the company site are mostly glowing, with 82% being 5-star ratings. One 4-star rating says the device helps them remember to take a breathing break since it’s a physical device. Alternatives to MoonbirdMoonbird is a trailblazing device for handheld help with anxiety, but you can also browse plenty of other options, including: anxiety-relief productsproducts to help lower stressproducts to help you sleep betterMoonbird is different thanks to its focus on slow, intentional breathwork and the free app loaded with guided exercises, but it’s not the only handheld gadget for calmness and falling asleep. For example, Sensate is a newer vibrating device created to soothe users, lowering stress and anxiety via vibrations instead of the contracting and expanding effect that moonbird offers. Another way it’s unlike moonbird is that it isn’t designed to be held in your hand. Instead, it’s a pebble-shaped object you place on your chest. It comes with a lanyard you can wear around your neck, so your device doesn’t slip off as you’re lying down. Sensate more or less requires users to lie down in order to use it. Unlike moonbird, you do have to use the app to operate it. Additionally, Sensate is $299 — that’s $100 more than moonbird. It is available in different packages though, in case you want to purchase more than one at a time. Other tips for managing anxietyWhether you choose to test moonbird or not, the start of a new year is a great time to test methods that may help ease feelings of anxiety. If you can visit a health care professional, especially a mental health professional, great. This is an excellent first step in your mental health journey. Another good move is considering mindfulness programs, as they can help keep you in the present instead of an anxious future or dwelling on the past. Meditation is one of the other best approaches for better mental health, and you may notice a difference in one session (but don’t stress if it doesn’t happen that fast). Keeping an active lifestyle is also a natural way to combat anxiousness.

    "articleTextBody": "Anxiety can cause shortness of breath due to changes in heart rate. There are medications, breathing techniques, and mindfulness practices that can help.Experiencing shortness of breath (dyspnea) or other breathing difficulties can feel scary. But it’s a common symptom of anxiety.Many people worry that a symptom affecting their breathing must come from a physical issue. In fact, your mental health affects your physical health in a number of ways.While anxiety can cause shortness of breath and other physical symptoms, it’s important to acknowledge that experiencing shortness of breath for other reasons may also create anxiety.Here’s what you need to know about this symptom and when to see your doctor.Symptoms of anxiety and shortness of breathAnxiety is your body’s natural fear response. This is known as the fight-or-flight response. Your body reacts in physical and mental ways to prepare you to either fight or run from a threatening situation.Shortness of breath is one of those responses. You may feel like you can’t catch your breath, tightness in your chest, or like you’re suffocating or hungry for air.Studies have shown a strong association between anxiety and respiratory symptoms, including shortness of breath.Other symptoms that can occur during this response and as a result of anxiety include:faster breathing (hyperventilation)chest tightnessbreathlessness or a feeling of suffocationfeeling like you have a lump in your throatmuscle tensionheart palpitations (feels like a stronger, faster heartbeat)feeling faint, dizzy, or unsteadynausea or stomach discomfortrestlessness, irritability, or feeling on edgeWhat causes shortness of breath from anxiety?Shortness of breath and other physical symptoms happen in the fight-or-flight response to protect you. With anxiety, you may not be running for your life. But your body still responds as if you are.You experience chest tightening, shortness of breath, and faster breathing because your body is trying to get more oxygen to your muscles, preparing you to run. Your heart rate increases and you may feel hot as more blood pumps into your muscles, preparing you to fight.All of these symptoms are normal body responses designed to save your life.Of course, you probably aren’t often running or fighting for your life — from wild bear attacks or men with chain saws. But your body still reacts to your trip to the crowded grocery store, your work presentation, and other anxiety-provoking events as if you were.How to get rid of shortness of breath from anxietyWhen you’re experiencing shortness of breath from an anxiety attack, it may seem counterintuitive that your breathing is what you should focus on.But by focusing on your breathing, you can get it under control and the right amount of oxygen into your lungs.Experts recommend practicing diaphragmatic breathing. This is a type of breathing technique that uses your diaphragm — the most efficient breathing muscle we have.When you’re experiencing shortness of breath, you’re generally breathing from your mouth or chest. But diaphragmatic breathing can:slow your breathing ratedecrease your demand for oxygenuse less effort and energy to breatheHere’s how to practice diaphragmatic breathing:Sit up comfortably in a chair or lie back on a flat surface, like your bed, with your head supported.Place one hand on your upper chest and the other below your rib cage. This will allow you to better feel your diaphragm as you breathe.Breathe in slowly through your nose so your stomach moves out against your hand.Tighten your stomach muscles. Let them fall inward as you exhale through your nose or your mouth (depending on what’s easier for you).Continue to take deep breaths in and out, feeling your stomach rise in and out. Do this for 5 to 10 minutes a day.Tips: You’re less likely to experience shortness of breath or hyperventilation while breathing in and out through your nose. It’s also normal to get tired or feel like it’s a lot of effort when you first begin this breathing practice. With more practice, this breathing technique will become automatic and easy.“The more you can slow down the physical sensations during periods of high anxiety, the more you can use your rational mind to assess what is going on.” Elke Zuercher-White in “An End to Panic”You can also try these anxiety-relieving techniques:Grounding techniques. One type of grounding technique (progressive muscle relaxation) involves clenching muscles and slowly releasing them. Focus entirely on these sensations.Mindful distractions. Find something to distract your mind from panicking to help you calm down. Try describing things around you to keep your focus on something else. What color is your couch? What is its texture?Talk with yourself. Now that you know these symptoms are a part of your body’s automatic response, remind yourself of this. In the moment of panic or anxiety, tell yourself “I can’t breathe because my body is trying to get more oxygen” or “I’ve been evaluated and my heart is fine.” Talking with yourself rationally can pull you out of the anxiety.Exercise. It may seem strange to exercise in the midst of an anxiety attack, but going for a quick run or expending some of that built-up energy may actually work for you. Your body is preparing itself to run anyway — you might as well take advantage of it.Self-care. You can practice self-care in simple ways. Drink herbal tea (but avoid caffeinated tea, as it can increase anxiety). Light candles with a pleasant aroma. Write down your feelings. Turn on some soothing music.Shock yourself. Shocking your system by dipping your face in a bowl of ice water is actually a technique recommended by therapists to help pull you out of a thought spiral.If you notice shortness of breath before experiencing a full-blown panic attack, learn to recognize it and don’t ignore it. Start focusing on your breathing before the anxiety escalates.For long-term strategies, consider seeing a mental health professional. They can evaluate your needs and help teach you coping mechanisms that’ll work for you.Practicing your breathing daily, other forms of mindfulness, and taking up relaxing yoga may also help.How to prevent losing your breath when you’re anxiousThe main way to prevent shortness of breath and other physical symptoms of anxiety is to practice techniques and learn your triggers when you’re not experiencing them.You don’t prepare for an earthquake during an earthquake; you prepare beforehand. Anxiety is the same.One of the most helpful preventive techniques is to maintain a thought log. In a thought log, you write down the automatic thoughts you had in your last moment of anxiety or panic. It’s helpful for discovering triggers as well as helping you reflect on your anxiety in a calmer state.You can also write down what sensations you’re experiencing while you’re experiencing them. This can help your doctor understand what’s going on.There are several types of thought logs. Check out this one focusing on dysfunctional thinking or a general anxiety tracker. You can even make your own by recording:the datethe specific trigger (the situation or physical symptom, such as shortness of breath)the automatic thought (what you think will happen due to this physical symptom or situation)how strongly you believe this thought (1 to 100 percent)If you’re experiencing shortness of breath, your automatic thought may be that you must have a serious health condition. At the moment, you may have believed it — almost 100 percent.However, after challenging this thought now in your recording, you only believe it 20 percent. Recording, reviewing, and challenging these thoughts is an essential way to prevent future anxiety.You can also use an app to track your anxiety.Practicing regular meditation may also help you reduce your anxiety. Numerous studies have shown that meditation can reduce anxiety symptoms and help treat anxiety.You can also practice mindfulness in everyday activities to help you become more aware of your body and what makes you anxious. Try a mindful eating exercise or a mindful walk around the block.Finally, consider working with a mental health professional to come up with more strategies. They can help you work out negative thought processes that occur when you’re experiencing anxiety, especially if this anxiety is severe or causing you great distress.TreatmentsVarious forms of psychotherapy may be recommended to ease anxiety and reduce symptoms like shortness of breath, including cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT).Certain medications may also be beneficial, including:Antidepressants. These medications affect levels of certain neurotransmitters to treat anxiety and depression. They are often used as a long-term solution, as it may take several weeks before you notice any benefits.Benzodiazepines. This class of medication includes drugs like Xanax and Valium, which act as a sedative to calm you down when you’re feeling anxious. However, they are only recommended for short-term use, as they can also cause side effects like drowsiness.Beta-blockers. Though typically used to treat high blood pressure, beta-blockers like propranolol can also reduce short-term physical symptoms of anxiety.Buspirone. This medication is sometimes used to treat anxiety when antidepressants don’t work. Though buspirone is as effective as benzodiazepines and is associated with fewer risks and side effects, it may take 2–4 weeks to take effect.Other conditions that cause shortness of breathShortness of breath and other symptoms of anxiety can mimic other conditions. So, it’s a good idea to monitor your symptoms and get a checkup with your doctor to rule out any other conditions.Getting a physical to ensure you don’t have any other issues can also alleviate some of your anxiety. For instance, in a panic attack, many people believe they’re having a heart attack. This fear only increases their panic.Other causes of shortness of breath include:exercisealtitude changestight clothinga sedentary lifestyleOther conditions where you may experience shortness of breath include:asthmachronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)heart failure or heart attackpneumonialow blood pressureupper airway obstructionWhen to see your doctorIf you experience shortness of breath consistently, or when unconnected to anxiety, see your doctor.Seek emergency medical attention if you experience symptoms of a heart attack, including:tightness or pain in the chest, neck, jaw, back, or armsfatiguelightheadedness, nausea, or vomitingdiscomfort in your arm or shouldersweating more than usual without a logical reasonFrequently asked questions\n{\n  \"@context\": \"https://schema.org\",\n  \"@type\": \"FAQPage\",\n  \"mainEntity\": [{\n    \"@type\": \"Question\",\n    \"name\": \"When is shortness of breath serious?\",\n    \"acceptedAnswer\": {\n      \"@type\": \"Answer\",\n      \"text\": \"If shortness of breath is accompanied by other symptoms like pain or discomfort, tightness in the chest, lightheadedness, nausea, or vomiting, it's important to seek medical attention immediately.\nYou should also talk with a doctor if you have experienced shortness of breath for over 1 month or if other symptoms like persistent coughing or swollen ankles are present, as it could be a sign of a more serious condition.\"\n    }\n  },{\n    \"@type\": \"Question\",\n    \"name\": \"Is my shortness of breath an anxiety attack or Coronavirus?\",\n    \"acceptedAnswer\": {\n      \"@type\": \"Answer\",\n      \"text\": \"Shortness of breath caused by an anxiety attack typically peaks within a few minutes and may be accompanied by other symptoms, such as nausea, heart palpitations, and sweating.\nOn the other hand, shortness of breath caused by COVID-19 lasts for a longer period of time and may be tied to additional symptoms, including fever, dry cough, chills, muscle pain, and a sore throat.\"\n    }\n  },{\n    \"@type\": \"Question\",\n    \"name\": \"Why do I have shortness of breath and anxiety at night?\",\n    \"acceptedAnswer\": {\n      \"@type\": \"Answer\",\n      \"text\": \"Many people experience panic or anxiety attacks at night, which can cause shortness of breath and may occur without any obvious triggers.

You won’t suffocate, won’t stop breathing, and won’t die from an anxiety attack. An anxiety or panic attack won’t turn into a heart attack, either.If you’re worried about your physical health, get checked out. Once you’ve been cleared of any physical reasons for your shortness of breath, hold onto that clean bill of health as a reminder when you’re back in an anxious moment.See a mental health professional for further help and assistance with coping techniques.",

    "articleTextBody": "A note on supplementsBefore trying any new supplements for anxiety, it’s important to ask your healthcare professional about potential medication interactions or safety concerns. While supplements may be used to help manage anxiety, they do not provide a cure. Therefore, when selecting supplements, be wary of products that claim to treat or cure anxiety disorders. A quick look at the best supplements for managing your anxietyPure Encapsulations Magnesium GlycinateNOW Foods SaffronMegaFood Vitamin D3Nature’s Way ChamomileIntegrative Therapeutics L-TheanineNordic Naturals ProOmegaQuicksilver Scientific Liposomal Vitamin CPure Encapsulations Curcumin 500 with BioperineCharlotte’s Web 25MG CBD Oil Liquid CapsulesMultivitaminsAnxiety is a common mental health condition. In fact, over 33% of people will experience an anxiety disorder during their lifetime (1).Anxiety disorders include generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), panic disorder with or without agoraphobia, social anxiety disorder (SAD), specific phobias, and separation anxiety disorder. Treatment often involves psychological therapies, such as cognitive behavior therapy or medication (1).However, research suggests that dietary changes, including taking certain vitamins, minerals, and other supplements, may also be helpful for people with anxiety disorders.The supplements on this list were chosen based on the following criteria: Efficacy. The primary ingredients are supported by current research to be safe and effective. Brand reputation. The supplements are produced by reputable brands that use third-party testing.Quality. The supplements prioritize high quality ingredients.Here are 10 of the best supplements for anxiety.A note on priceGeneral price ranges with dollar signs ($–$$$) are indicated below. One dollar sign means the product is rather affordable, whereas three dollar signs indicate a higher cost.Generally, prices range from $0.06–$2.50 per count, or $13–$74.99 per container, though this may vary depending on where you shop.Pricing guide:$ = under $0.25 per serving$$ = $0.25–$0.75 per serving$$$ = over $0.75 per servingNote that the dosage recommendations vary between 1–3 capsules or tablets 1–5 times daily.Thus, a product that you need to take fewer times per day may end up being comparatively cheaper, despite having a higher price per count than a product that you need to take multiple times per day.Healthline’s picks of the best supplements for anxietyPure Encapsulations Magnesium GlycinatePrice: $Magnesium is an essential mineral that plays an important role in the body’s stress response (2).Additionally, research suggests that magnesium supplements may be beneficial for people with anxiety and are generally safe and well tolerated.For example, a 2017 review of 18 studies concluded that although the quality of existing studies on the subject is poor, magnesium supplements are likely to benefit people with anxiety (3).Another 2017 study of 112 people with depression found that taking 248 milligrams (mg) of elemental magnesium supplements daily for 6 weeks significantly improved symptoms of depression and anxiety, compared with a control group (4).Pure Encapsulations Magnesium Glycinate is a highly absorbable form of magnesium, making it a good choice for those with anxiety (5).The supplements are certified by United States Pharmacopeia (USP), an independent, nonprofit organization that sets strict standards for identity, quality, and purity of dietary supplements (6).In addition to being tested by third-party labs, Pure Encapsulations supplements are also certified gluten-free and GMO-free (6). Each capsule provides 120 mg of magnesium. Shop now at AmazonNOW Foods Saffron 50mg Veg Capsules Price: $$$Saffron is a brightly hued spice that has culinary and medicinal uses. It’s loaded with antioxidant compounds and may be especially beneficial for people with anxiety when used as a supplement.A 2018 review of 100 studies found that saffron supplements helped reduce anxiety. Some studies included in the review demonstrated that treatment with saffron had similar anti-anxiety effects when compared with the anti-anxiety medication fluoxetine (7).Similarly, a 2016 study in 60 people with depression and anxiety found that supplementation with 100 mg of saffron per day for 12 weeks significantly reduced symptoms of anxiety, compared with a placebo. The supplement was also well tolerated by the participants (8).However, pregnant people should speak with their doctors, as limited research suggests that saffron supplements may cause uterine contractions (9).NOW Foods Saffron is a good option, as the supplements are non-GMO, vegan, and gluten-free and undergo third-party testing for potency and purity. Each capsule provides 50 mg of saffron, with recommendations to take 1 capsule twice per day or as directed by your healthcare professional.

These nutrients work synergistically in the body to help maintain healthy levels of vitamin K and to promote heart and bone health (16).This supplement delivers 5,000 IU of vitamin D and 100% of the Daily Value for vitamin K in just 1 capsule. As a result, it’s a good choice for people with low vitamin D levels.Keep in mind that while higher dose vitamin D supplements may be necessary to treat deficiency, for people who simply want to maintain healthy vitamin D levels, a supplement that provides 1,000–2,000 IU per day may be more appropriate. Your healthcare professional can test your vitamin D levels and recommend a dose of vitamin D for your specific needs.

While it’s more commonly consumed as a tea, chamomile supplements may provide benefits for people with anxiety. In fact, research suggests that chamomile has anti-anxiety and antidepressant properties (17). One study in 93 people with moderate to severe GAD found that daily treatment with 1,500 mg of pharmaceutical grade chamomile extract for 26 weeks significantly reduced anxiety symptoms, compared with a placebo treatment (18).Nature’s Way Chamomile is a good option, as it’s gluten-free and certified by TRU-ID, a certification program that uses DNA testing on ingredients and finished products to prevent adulteration (19).Each serving provides 440 mg of chamomile flower and 250 mg chamomile extract.However, keep in mind that pregnant people and people who are allergic to related plants such as ragweed, chrysanthemums, marigolds, or daisies, should avoid taking chamomile supplements due to potential safety issues.Additionally, chamomile supplements may interact with some medications, including those used to treat anxiety, so it’s important to consult your doctor before taking chamomile supplements.

It’s been shown to have stress-relieving and anti-anxiety effects when taken in supplement form (20). A 2020 review of 9 studies found that taking doses of L-theanine ranging from 200–400 mg per day may help reduce stress and anxiety in people who are exposed to stressful conditions (21).L-theanine supplements have also been shown to help reduce anxiety symptoms in people with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder and major depressive disorder (22, 23).Integrative Therapeutics L-Theanine is one of the best options, as the company tests raw materials and finished products to ensure quality, purity, and potency.

In particular, the Nordic Naturals ProOmega supplement is a good choice for those with anxiety, as it provides 2,000 mg of omega-3s per 2 softgel serving.The Nordic Naturals website provides a certificate of analysis for each supplement to document that it has undergone testing for quality and purity and adheres to specifications and standards (25).Shop now at AmazonQuicksilver Scientific Liposomal Vitamin CPrice: $$$Vitamin C is a nutrient that functions as a powerful antioxidant in the body, and researchers suggest that vitamin C may help combat damage caused by oxidative stress in people with neuropsychological disorders, including anxiety (26).Furthermore, several studies have demonstrated benefits of vitamin C supplements in people with anxiety (27).For instance, one study in 42 high school students found that taking 500 mg of vitamin C per day for 14 days increased blood vitamin C levels and reduced anxiety levels, compared with a placebo (28).Vitamin C supplements have also been shown to be effective in reducing anxiety symptoms in women and in adults with diabetes (27).Quicksilver Scientific Liposomal Vitamin C delivers 1,000 mg of highly absorbable vitamin C per teaspoon (5 mL). The supplement contains liposomal vitamin C, a form of vitamin C that’s encased in tiny lipid spheres and has been shown to be more bioavailable than non-liposomal vitamin C (29).This vitamin C supplement comes in a convenient liquid form, which makes it an excellent choice for people who can’t or don’t like to swallow pills.Shop now at AmazonPure Encapsulations Curcumin 500 with Bioperine Price: $$Curcumin is a polyphenol compound found in turmeric that’s been shown to have powerful antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties and may have antidepressant and anti-anxiety properties as well (30).A 2017 study in 123 people with major depressive disorder demonstrated that those who received 500–1,000 mg of curcumin or 500 mg of curcumin combined with 30 mg of saffron per day for 12 weeks had greater improvements in anxiety symptoms than those who took a placebo (31).Curcumin has also been shown to reduce anxiety in people with diabetes and in people with obesity and depression (32, 33).Pure Encapsulations Curcumin 500 with Bioperine is one of the best curcumin supplements, as it delivers 500 mg of curcumin per capsule along with Bioperine, a black pepper extract that significantly increases the absorption of curcumin (30).Shop now at AmazonCharlotte’s Web 25MG CBD Oil Liquid CapsulesPrice: $$$Cannabidiol (CBD) has become a popular natural remedy for a number of health conditions, including anxiety. Evidence suggests that CBD, when used in doses ranging from 300–600 mg, may help reduce anxiety in people with SAD, as well as in people without anxiety disorders (34).In addition, a recent review of 25 studies found that CBD may help reduce anxiety in people with SAD. However, the researchers acknowledged that many of the studies are low quality, so more high quality research is needed (35).Charlotte’s Web is a CBD brand that’s trusted by healthcare professionals, as the company is committed to keeping customers safe and informed.Charlotte’s Web provides a certificate of analysis for each of its products. This documentation supplies the consumer with information on the quantity of cannabinoids, as well as information on levels of pesticides, heavy metals, and tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) found in the products (36).Charlotte’s Web 25MG CBD Oil Liquid Capsules are a convenient way to take CBD, offering 25 mg of CBD per capsule.

Before taking CBD, it’s important to talk with your healthcare professional to discuss your optimal dose. Shop now at Charlotte’s WebMultivitaminsPrice: $–$$$Research suggests that multivitamin supplements may help improve anxiety symptoms. For example, one study found that taking a multivitamin containing B vitamins, vitamin C, calcium, magnesium, and zinc for 30 days led to a significant decrease in anxiety symptoms in young adults, compared with a placebo (37).Additionally, an older review of 8 studies found that treatment with multivitamin and multimineral supplements for at least 28 days reduced levels of perceived stress and anxiety in healthy people (38). The review also found that supplements containing high-dose vitamin B complex may be more effective than those containing low doses of B vitamins (38).Keep in mind that multivitamins aren’t one size fits all, and some multivitamins may be inappropriate for certain people, as nutrient needs depend on several factors, including age, gender, and overall health. For example, younger women may benefit from additional iron in their diet, whereas men and postmenopausal women typically have lower iron needs.Before taking a multivitamin for anxiety, be sure to talk with your healthcare professional, as they can help you choose a product that’s appropriate for your needs.Interested in a multivitamin?See our experts’ picks for the best men’s multivitamins and and best women’s multivitamins.How to choose If you’re interested in taking supplements to manage anxiety, it’s important to speak with your healthcare professional first.Not all supplements are safe or appropriate for people with anxiety, especially if you’re taking one or more medications.Also, be aware of supplement blends that are marketed to treat or cure anxiety.

    "articleTextBody": "What are service dogs?Service dogs act as companions and aides to people who have a disability. Traditionally, this has included people with visual impairment, hearing impairments, or mobility impairments. Many people are familiar with this type of service animal. These dogs can also assist people who have a condition that isn’t visible, such as diabetes. This is also true of mental health conditions, such as post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, and anxiety. Service dogs differ from regular pets. To be legally recognized as a service animal, these dogs are trained to perform tasks that can help someone with a disability. Depending on the person’s needs, this can mean anything from bringing a person their medication during times of crisis to finding help during a medical emergency. What are psychiatric service dogs?Just like “standard” service dogs, psychiatric service dogs are trained to help a person accomplish necessary tasks and protect them from harm. Psychiatric service dogs typically assist people who have mental health conditions that interfere with their day-to-day lives. A psychiatric service dog may help someone with anxiety by:bringing medication, or water to help swallow medication, during an anxiety attack bringing a phone over during an anxiety attack, which you can use to call your therapist or other support system leading someone to you if you’re in crisis providing tactile stimulation, such as licking your face, to help disrupt an emotional overload providing pressure against your chest or abdomen to create a calming effect during moments of distressSometimes, people mistake emotional support dogs for psychiatric service dogs. An emotional support animal simply provides the owner with a therapeutic presence. These animals aren’t trained to perform any tasks. This is because their presence is meant to mitigate any psychological or emotional symptoms you may be experiencing.  How to get a service dogYou must meet several criteria to be eligible for a service dog. This may include:having a physical disability or debilitating illness or disorderbeing able to participate in the dog’s training processbeing able to independently command and care for a service doghaving a stable home environmentService dogs are trained to meet a person’s needs before they’re placed in someone’s home. A dog that has already served as a pet usually can’t be trained later as service dog. To apply for a psychiatric service dog, you will need a recommendation from a medical doctor or licensed mental health professional.About 18 percent of American adults experience some form of mental health disorder. Overall, about 4 percent of American adults experience a severe or debilitating mental health disorder. This means that only a fraction of people who have a mental health disorder are qualified for a psychiatric service dog.People who have anxiety that isn’t as debilitating may benefit from an emotional support animal. These domestic animals aren’t limited to canines. They’re intended to provide comforting companionship. Emotional support animals are still regarded as pets in most situations. This means they don’t have the same legal protections as service animals in public and private spaces. These animals are afforded a few of the same provisions, though. A person with an emotional support animal is still qualified for no-pet housing and may fly with the animal without paying an extra fee. People who believe they will benefit from an emotional support animal also need a prescription letter from a mental health professional. What are other ways to cope with anxiety?Coping with anxiety varies from person to person, so it’s important to find what works for you. What you may need depends on how you’re feeling and what’s triggering your anxiety. Some general tips include: going for a walkpracticing mindfulnessperforming breathing exercisesgetting a full night’s sleepexercising regularlyIf you need help, reach out to your therapist or a mental health professional. If you don’t have one, the National Alliance on Mental Illness offers tips for how to find the right therapist or doctor for you. The organization also offers help in finding someone in your area. This can be done online or by calling 800-950-NAMI. If you need immediate medical attention, you should call your local emergency services.  What you can do nowIf you think that you would benefit from a service dog or emotional support animal, you should reach out to a therapist or another mental health professional. They can work with you to determine whether a service dog or emotional support animal is the best fit for you. Keep reading: The best anxiety health blogs of the year »",

    "articleTextBody": "Antioxidants, vitamins, zinc, and magnesium may help improve depression- and anxiety-related symptoms. One way to incorporate more of these nutrients is by juicing different fruits and vegetables.Anxiety and depression are predominantly treated with prescription medication, therapy, or a combination of both. You may wonder whether there’s a more natural way of managing these conditions.This article explores the potential benefits of juicing as a supporting treatment for anxiety and depression.EffectivenessJuicing is an effective and convenient way to add more nutrients from fruits and vegetables to your diet. As such, it may help aid anxiety and depression.Healthy dietary patterns, including higher intakes of whole foods, fruits, and vegetables and a limited intake of processed foods, are associated with a lower risk of mood disorders.Researchers believe that vitamins, minerals, and beneficial plant compounds from different fruits and vegetables — which you can get from many types of juice — may offer protective effects on mental health.For example, one 2023 study in Korean adults found that including fruits and vegetables, among other components, as part of a high quality diet was associated with a lower risk of stress and depression and a better quality of life.Additionally, evidence suggests that certain vitamins — including magnesium, zinc, and vitamin C — may improve anxiety and depression symptoms.For example, past research has found low dietary intakes of magnesium and zinc are associated with an increased risk for depression. Other research suggests that vitamin C may offer antidepressant-like effects. These nutrients may stabilize:mood in episodes of maniafeelings of despairaverage heart rateThere’s no one-size-fits-all remedy or treatment when it comes to mental health. Be sure to consult with a healthcare professional if you have any concerns about your treatment.SummaryJuicing is a simple way to get more nutrients from fruits and vegetables, which may improve symptoms of anxiety and depression.Beneficial nutrientsJuice is full of nutrients like: antioxidantsmagnesiumB vitaminsvitamin CzincAll of which may have positive effects on anxiety and depression symptoms.AntioxidantsAnxiety and depression are associated with increased brain oxidative stress.Research suggests oxidative stress occurs when harmful molecules called free radicals build up in your body and damage tissues and cells due to an impaired antioxidant defense system.According to some research, oxidative stress is a major component of inflammation processes related to depressive- and anxiety-like behaviors.Studies have also found that low levels of antioxidants are associated with more oxidative damage in the brain.Having low levels of antioxidants is especially true for the Western diet, which is high in highly processed foods.Studies have found Western diets in adolescents are associated with an increased risk for depressive symptoms, while the opposite was true for the Mediterranean diet. A key difference is that the Mediterranean diet is characterized by high consumption of fruits and vegetables, both of which are potent sources of antioxidants.An antioxidant-rich diet can help remove free radicals and protect against oxidative stress-induced damage in the brain, which research suggests may help lessen anxiety symptoms.MagnesiumMagnesium plays a key role in brain function and mood. In fact, research has linked low magnesium diets with depression and anxiety.There are two potential ways that magnesium has antidepressant and anti-anxiety effects.First, past research suggests magnesium deficiency leads to an up-regulated stress system caused by an impairment of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis.The HPA axis plays a big role in your:moodemotionshow you react to stressSo, impairing the HPA axis can affect how you process stress. This, in turn, may promote the development of anxiety disorders and depression.Second, magnesium modulates your serotonergic, noradrenergic, and dopaminergic chemical systems.These systems affect: moodmotivationrewardAs such, they’re often the target of traditional antidepressant drugs.Combined, this means that magnesium may improve anxiety and depression symptoms by regulating both the HPA axis activity and influencing your brain’s chemical systems.Evidence also suggests that magnesium may be an effective therapy when combined with antidepressant drugs.B vitaminsLow levels of vitamins B1 (thiamine), B2, B6, and B12 have been linked to a higher risk of depression in past research.Vitamin B6 is essential for converting the amino acid tryptophan into serotonin, also known as the happiness hormone. As such, it may have mood-enhancing effects.Plus, vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) and B12 (cobalamin) deficiency prevent serotonin from being produced from an amino acid known as homocysteine. This leads to elevated homocysteine levels, which may worsen depression symptoms.Another B vitamin, vitamin B9 (folate), and B12 work together to control homocysteine levels. Research has associated elevated levels of homocysteine with more oxidative stress.It’s worth noting, though, that one 2020 study observed these beneficial effects only when folate came from natural sources like fruits and vegetables. Folate from fortified foods didn’t appear to offer the same results.Vitamin CResearch has also found an inverse relationship between vitamin C (ascorbic acid) and stress-related disorders, including anxiety and depression. This means that low levels of the vitamin may increase the risk of depression, while high levels are associated with improved mood.Vitamin C is an antioxidant, which is why it may combat:anxietydepressionother stress-related disordersJust like magnesium, vitamin C appears to participate in the serotonergic, noradrenergic, and dopaminergic chemical systems. If dysregulated, these systems are believed to contribute to depression.Past animal studies show that supplementing with vitamin C may have antidepressant-like effects and improve mood.ZincZinc is a micronutrient with antioxidant-like properties that contributes to the oxidative defense mechanism similar to some B vitamins.Supplementation with zinc has also been linked to a decrease in depression-like symptoms in past studies.Other studies suggest that zinc supplementation, taken in combination with or without antidepressants, may help reduce depression symptoms. Animal studies on zinc supplementation observed it may reduce depressive-like behaviors.Combining zinc supplementation with antidepressant therapy was found to reduce depression symptoms in a 2021 research review.SummaryJuicing can help you increase your intake of antioxidants, magnesium, B vitamins, vitamin C, and zinc, which may reduce anxiety and depression symptoms and improve the efficacy of antidepressant drugs.Best ingredientsA benefit of juicing is that you can add just about any fruit or vegetable you can think of.If you’re considering juicing to improve anxiety and depression symptoms, try to choose ingredients that provide antioxidants, magnesium, B vitamins, vitamin C, and zinc.But juicing can be high in sugar, which can lead to weight gain and other complications. Try juicing with vegetables and adding a small amount of fruit for sweetness to avoid this.Here are some ingredients with these nutrients to start you off:Antioxidants: broccoli, celery, cabbage, beets, kale, berriesMagnesium: kale, cabbage, green leafy vegetablesB vitamins: broccoli, spinach, cabbage, eggs, low fat milk, yogurt, sunflower seed butterVitamin C: broccoli, celery, cabbage, kale, bell peppers, zucchini, citrus fruitsZinc: kale, beet greensYou can even mix and match these ingredients when preparing your juice to ensure a nutrient variety.SummaryInclude various fruits and vegetables in your juice to ensure you get the desired nutrients.The takeawayJuicing is an effective and natural way to add more vitamins, antioxidants, and beneficial plant compounds from fruits and vegetables to your diet. This may improve depression and anxiety symptoms.Increasing your intake of antioxidants, magnesium, B vitamins, vitamin C, and zinc may improve your symptoms or the efficacy of certain prescription medications.However, keep in mind that juicing is meant to accompany the treatment prescribed by your doctor, not replace it.Be sure to talk with your doctor before making any dietary changes.",

These can include getting more exercise, mindfulness practices, and eating a well-balanced diet.Minimizing the chronic stress of daily life as much as possible can support your overall health. Chronic stress can increase your risk of health conditions, including:heart diseaseanxiety disordersdepressionCertain factors may affect your vulnerability to stress. These can include:geneticslevel of social supportcoping stylepersonality typediscrimination due to race, gender, or perceived gender, LBGTQIA+, socioeconomic status, or other factorschildhood traumayour professionStress and mental health conditionsStress isn’t the same as mental health disorders such as anxiety and depression.Although the tips below may relieve many types of stress, they are not a substitute for treatment from a mental health professional.1. Get more physical activity A 6-week study of 185 university students found that participating in aerobic exercise 2 days per week significantly reduced overall perceived stress and perceived stress due to uncertainty. The CDC recommends 150 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise per week, as well as two days of muscle-strengthening activity.If you’re currently inactive, start with gentle activities such as walking or biking. Choosing an activity you enjoy can help increase your chances of sticking to it in the long term. 2. Eat a balanced diet A 2022 review of research suggests that people who follow a diet high in ultra-processed foods and added sugar are more likely to experience higher perceived stress levels.Additionally, being chronically stressed may lead you to overeat and consume more ultra-processed foods.If you do not eat enough nutrient-dense whole foods, you may increase your risk of deficiencies in nutrients essential for regulating stress and mood, such as magnesium and B vitamins.Minimizing your intake of highly processed foods and beverages and eating more whole foods can help ensure your body is properly nourished, and it may improve your resilience to stress. Whole food options can include:vegetablesfruitsbeansfishnutsseedsMeals with whole foodsChicken and squash bakeGreen bean salad with quinoa and fetaTomato, orzo, and white bean soupSummer roll bowlsSuperfoods shake3. Minimize screen time  A 2021 review of literature points out that several studies have linked excessive smartphone use with increased stress levels.Screen time may also negatively affect sleep, which may also lead to increased stress levels.4. Practice self-careSelf-care doesn’t have to be elaborate or complicated. It simply means tending to your well-being and happiness. Engaging in self-care is associated with lower levels of stress and improved quality of life. Examples of self-care include:going for a walk outsidetaking a bathlighting candlesreading a good bookexercisingpreparing a healthy mealstretching before bedgetting a massagepracticing a hobbyusing a diffuser with calming scentspracticing yoga5. Try journalingJournaling may help reduce stress and provide a positive outlet for your thoughts and emotions.You can also try a guided journal if you’d prefer more targeted, expressive writing.6. Reduce your caffeine intakeConsuming too much caffeine may worsen stress, according to a 2021 review of literature. Overconsumption may also harm your sleep, which can increase stress.Although coffee has health benefits in moderation, it’s recommended to keep caffeine intake under 400 mg daily, which equals 4–5 cups (0.9–1.2 L) of coffee.Coffee alternativesMatcha green tea shakeVanilla chai tea shakeChai spice shakeCarrot ginger smoothie7. Spend time with loved onesHaving a social support system is important for your overall mental health. A 2019 study in 163 ​​Latinx college-age young adults associated lower levels of support from friends, family, and romantic partners with higher perceived stress.If you do not have friends or family to depend on, social support groups may help. Consider joining a club or sports team or volunteering for a cause that’s important to you.8. Create boundaries and learn to say noBeing selective about what you take on — and saying “no” to things that will unnecessarily add to your load — can reduce your stress levels.Creating boundaries, especially with people who add to your stress levels, is a healthy way to protect your well-being. This can be as simple as asking a friend or family member not to stop by unannounced or taking a rain check on plans if you are feeling overwhelmed.9. Avoid procrastinationProcrastination can cause stress, which negatively affects your health and sleep quality. You may also be more likely to procrastinate in times of stress as a coping mechanism.A study in 140 medical students linked procrastination to increased stress levels. If you find yourself procrastinating regularly, it may be helpful to make a to-do list. Give yourself realistic deadlines and work your way down the list in order of priority. Sometimes, adding an item to the list may help you feel better about it, even if it doesn’t get done immediately.10. Take a yoga classResearch shows that yoga can help reduce stress and promote psychological well-being.Yoga may also help lower cortisol levels, blood pressure, and heart rate while increasing levels of gamma aminobutyric acid, a neurotransmitter that’s low in people with mood disorders.Mindful moves: 15-minute yoga flow for anxiety11. Practice mindfulnessStress reduction techniques that utilize mindfulness include meditation and mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT), a type of cognitive behavioral therapy.Meditating consistently, even for short periods, may help boost your mood and decrease symptoms of stress and anxiety. There are many apps and websites that can help you get started with meditation. There may also be therapists in your area who specialize in MBCT.How to hold spaceHolding space is a form of mindfulness that can reduce stress. It involves allowing yourself to feel your emotions without self-criticism. Learn how to hold space for yourself.12. CuddleStudies show positive physical contact may help relieve stress.These types of contact may help release oxytocin and lower cortisol. In turn, these effects help lower blood pressure and heart rate. High blood pressure and increased heart rate are physical symptoms of stress.13. Spend time in natureA review of 14 studies found that spending as little as 10 minutes in a natural setting may help improve psychological and physiological markers of mental well-being, including perceived stress, in college-aged people.Hiking and camping are great options, but some people don’t enjoy — or have access to — these activities. Even in an urban area, you can seek out green spaces such as:local parksarboretumsbotanical gardens14. Practice deep breathingStudies have associated diaphragmatic breathing with stress reduction.Deep breathing exercises include:diaphragmatic breathingalternate nostril breathingbox breathingDeep breathing aims to focus your awareness on your breath, making it slower and deeper. When you breathe in deeply through your nose, your lungs fully expand, and your belly rises. This helps slow your heart rate.15. Spend time with a petHaving a pet may help reduce stress and improve your mood. When you cuddle or touch your pet, your body releases oxytocin — a hormone linked to positive moods.Having a pet may also help relieve stress by:giving you purposekeeping you activeproviding companionship16. Consider supplementsSeveral vitamins and minerals play an important role in your body’s stress response and mood regulation. A deficiency in one or more nutrients may affect your mental health and ability to cope with stress.For example, your magnesium levels may deplete when you’re chronically stressed. Since this mineral plays an important role in your body’s stress response, you may want to ensure you’re getting enough each day. Supplementing with magnesium has been linked to decreased stress in chronically stressed people.A note on supplementsIt is important to talk to a doctor before starting any supplement, even if it is available over-the-counter. Dietary supplements may not be appropriate for everyone, and your doctor will be able to take your individual needs into account.The takeawayBeing chronically stressed can take a toll on your physical and mental health. Getting more exercise, practicing mindfulness, spending time with a pet, minimizing screen time, and getting outside more often are all ways that you can reduce stress.Read this article in Spanish.",

    "articleTextBody": "Maskot/Getty ImagesDo anxious feelings tend to bubble up suddenly while you’re at work? Do you get nervous just thinking about your job? Does your mood change come Monday morning, or Sunday evening, for that matter? If your anxiety revolves around work, you might be experiencing workplace anxiety, also known as work stress. And you’re most certainly not alone.According to Mental Health America’s 2021 Mind the Workplace report, almost 83 percent of respondents felt emotionally drained from their work. And 85 percent — or nearly 9 in 10 workers — reported that job stress affected their mental health.Of course, you don’t need to go into an office or job site to experience workplace anxiety. You can experience these feelings when working from home, too. (Zoom anxiety, anyone?)But the situation is far from hopeless. Here’s everything you need to know about workplace anxiety, along with practical strategies for reducing and managing work stress.Workplace anxiety vs. anxiety at workFirst, it’s not always easy to tell whether you’re experiencing workplace anxiety or symptoms of an anxiety disorder. The tell-tale sign? Your anxiety is limited to work.Annia Palacios, a licensed professional counselor (LPC) with Tightrope Therapy, offers a few key signs of workplace anxiety:On your days off, you feel pretty good and your anxiety lowers. If you work Monday through Friday, feelings of anxiety and dread overshadow your weekend, especially when you think about work.You have a tough time talking with colleagues due to a competitive work culture, but you have no problem chatting with people outside of work. How do you know when your symptoms might relate to generalized anxiety disorder or another anxiety condition? Anxiety disorder symptoms are “persistent, consistent, and negatively affect several aspects of your life,” says Emme Smith, a licensed psychotherapist and CEO of GraySpace Counseling Group.The key difference between the two, explains Alexandra Finkel, LCSW, a licensed psychotherapist and co-founder of Kind Minds Therapy, is that workplace anxiety generally develops in response to stress at work. An anxiety disorder, on the other hand, tends to develop, and persist, regardless of your work circumstances.Learn more about the signs and symptoms of anxiety disorders.What are the signs? Workplace anxiety can involve a wide range of symptoms. According to Palacios, you might:feel better at night but worse in the morningfeel physically ill when thinking about work or receiving work emails or callshave a hard time focusing on work-specific tasksnotice your motivation shrinkingoften procrastinate on work-related tasksavoid meetings, new projects, or work eventsYou might also experience a sense of dread when you think about going to work and feel overwhelmed once you get there, says Boone Christianson, a licensed marriage and family therapist (LMFT) and author of the book “101 Therapy Talks.”Workplace anxiety can involve physical symptoms, too. These might include: head and neck paintension in your bodysweating palmsconsistent stomach pain or nauseaWhat causes workplace anxiety? A number of factors can contribute to workplace anxiety, and these can vary from person to person. For example, says Palacios, work stress may stem from:needing to complete an urgent project or present at a meetingimposter syndrome, or a tendency to doubt yourself and feel deeply unqualifiednot having strong connections with colleaguesdealing with a difficult bosslacking a sense of purpose around your workAccording to Kimberly Wilson, PhD, LMFT, an organizational psychologist and therapist, you could also develop workplace anxiety if your job:has a toxic workplace culturecomes with unrealistic expectationslacks enough staffis highly competitivedidn’t provide proper trainingdoesn’t compensate you for overtimedoesn’t prioritize your health, wellness, or safetyIn some cases, your work stress can also have a deeper, more subtle underlying cause or contributing factor.For example, says Christianson, maybe you’ve had negative experiences in the past with making phone calls, or your boss reminds you of your dad. Maybe your college professor’s harsh criticism sharpened your sensitivity to any kind of feedback on writing-related tasks.As Palacios also points out, “being an anxious person or having a pre-existing anxiety disorder can make us more likely to experience workplace-specific anxiety.”For example, she notes, if you already live with anxiety you might go straight to the worst-case scenario. Consequently, your workplace might become a significant source of stress if you (mistakenly) assume: you’ll miss key deadlinesyour supervisor thinks you’re doing a terrible job you’ll always fall short of expectationsWhat can you do to manage workplace anxiety?Workplace anxiety can feel overwhelming and unrelenting. But with a few small steps, you can successfully overcome or manage your work stress.Pinpoint your triggersThe triggers of work stress aren’t always obvious. “Writing out moments when you feel nervous throughout the day will help you find patterns or triggers,” says Smith. Maybe you regularly feel nervous and nauseous before weekly team meetings, or you have trouble concentrating on anything after you encounter one specific co-worker. Identifying specific situations that increase your stress levels can help you figure out the best strategy to handle them going forward.Zero in on your core fear“Worry in the form of ‘what-ifs’ is a common type of workplace anxiety,” says Max Maisel, PhD, a licensed clinical psychologist in Los Angeles who specializes in anxiety disorders and OCD.To better understand what’s going on and explore possible solutions, you can try asking yourself questions about those “what-ifs” until you’ve uncovered your core fear. Maisel suggests “Why is that a bad thing?” and “What does this mean about me?” as good questions to start with. How do you know you’ve found your core fear?Typically, it’s “when you can no longer ask ‘Why is this a bad thing?’ or you feel a gut sense that you hit on something viscerally important,” says Maisel.When you’ve reached that place, he suggests acknowledging the story without assuming it’s true and then thanking your mind for trying to protect you. From there, you can gently challenge the fear by asking yourself:What’s the evidence for and against this? What would I say to a loved one who told me something similar? If the worst-case scenario happens, how would I cope? What’s actually most likely to happen?Be gentle with yourselfWhen you get anxious and stress levels soar, your natural inclination might be to respond with self-criticism. Instead, try to be patient and understanding with your reactions. How? You can start by labeling and leaning into your feelings. You might simply say, “I’m feeling frazzled right now, and that’s okay.”Similarly, you can also think about treating yourself like you’d treat a close friend or family member, says Maisel. You might say something like, “It’s OK to feel overwhelmed. You’re doing a lot. But you’re doing the best you can.” Take micro-breaksYou can recalibrate your emotions by taking small, short breaks throughout the day, according to Palacios. For instance, she suggests:walking away from your desk or task to recenter yourselfpracticing box breathing, where you inhale for a count of 4, hold for a count of 4, exhale for a count of 4, and hold for a count of 4When anxiety pulls your mind elsewhere, you can also try the 54321 technique to ground yourself in the present moment, says Finkel.To practice, she says, simply name:5 things you see4 things you hear3 things you feel2 things you smell1 thing you tasteFind 14 more mindfulness tricks to ease anxiety. Get movingDuring and after exercise, the body releases calming neurotransmitters that create an overall feeling of well-being, says Karlene Kerfoot, chief nursing officer at symplr.“Exercising before work can help your body cope with workplace situations that may cause anxiety, and exercise after work can help place you in a different mindset where you can better cope with such feelings,” she says.Get organizedWhen big projects and presentations produce anxiety, getting organized can help reduce feelings of overwhelm, says Finkel.She suggests:breaking down large tasks into smaller stepsassigning each step a completion date and timeIn other words, try to use your anxiety to propel you to accomplish tasks instead of putting them off. Set boundariesCould some boundaries help keep your work-related stressor in check? If your stress relates work-life balance or work relationships, Finkel suggests:setting a specific time to start and end your workdayengaging in one or two activities each week that honor your physical, emotional, and mental well-beingidentifying specific behaviors and tasks you will or won’t accept and communicating these boundaries to colleagues and clientsGet more tips for setting healthy boundaries. Laugh it upFinding something to laugh about can release tension, shift your perspective, and stimulate positive neurotransmitters, says Kerfoot. Humor can even help you take yourself, not to mention your workplace, less seriously.To give yourself a good laugh:talk or text with your funniest friendwatch a comedy special or funny filmtake yourself to an in-person comedy show reminisce about silly memoriesCreate a safe, soothing spaceIf you have a workspace, you can create a mini sanctuary or retreat that offers solace during stressful or anxiety-provoking situations, says Smith. For example, she says, you might:hang family photoskeep a few fidget toysadd a diffuser with essential oils, like calming lavenderBring along a comfort kitIf you don’t have a designated workspace, you can assemble a kit that provides a “quick shot of relief during stressful moments at work,” says Wilson.Your kit can include items that soothe your senses and help you move. Wilson offers a few examples:a Ziploc bag with cotton balls soaked in your favorite essential oil or perfume to smell when stresseda smooth rock with an inspiring word you can feel and read when upseta playlist to listen to during a lunchtime walkhard candy, gum, or dark chocolate to slowly savorBoost your time away from workStrive to create a life filled with relationships, events, and activities outside of work that bring you joy, peace, and happiness, Kerfoot recommends. She goes on to explain that a fulfilling life outside of work can: minimize the impact of that work-related stressbuild up your resilience in times of stress crowd out work-related thoughtsTo get started, consider the people, places, and pastimes that bring you joy and calm. How can you add them to your days?When to get supportIf you’re dealing with workplace anxiety, professional support can be incredibly helpful. How do you know when help from a therapist might have benefit? There’s no right or wrong time to connect with a therapist, Palacios says, so this decision will be unique to everyone.In general, however, she recommends seeking professional help when you want your life to be different but you haven’t found it possible to make changes on your own.Specifically, Palacios says, this could mean you:worry so much you can’t function, meet deadlines, or complete tasksfind it difficult to fall or stay asleepfeel nervous, edgy, and unlike yourselffind your usual coping strategies no longer helpneed to take more time off than usual and begin planning your next days off as soon as you return to workA therapist can offer support with: pinpointing triggers making value-based decisionsexploring and practicing helpful coping skillsdetermining when a new job might be a good optionCheck out our guide to finding the right therapist.The bottom lineWorkplace anxiety is common, but it’s very manageable. Small steps, like understanding your triggers, setting boundaries, and taking restorative breaks, can go a long way.That said, if your work stress becomes difficult to cope with alone, don’t hesitate to seek professional support. A therapist can always offer compassionate guidance with identifying possible causes and exploring your options for addressing them.

    "articleTextBody": "Situational anxiety is when you feel worry, fear, or nervousness whenever you encounter a specific situation. Gradual exposure to anxiety-provoking circumstances, relaxation strategies, and professional guidance can all help you cope.While situational anxiety isn’t a formal diagnosis, it describes a common shared experience for many people.What is situational anxiety?Situational anxiety involves short-duration, non-impairing anxiety occurring every time you encounter a particular situation or circumstance.Although situational anxiety is sometimes used interchangeably with “state anxiety,” these two concepts are similar but not identical. State anxiety refers to any feelings of anxiety affecting your current psychological “state.” They can be triggered by many things — not just a specific situation.While situational anxiety is a form of state anxiety, it defines anxiety specific to recurring scenarios, like test-taking, health appointments, or meeting new people.Situational anxiety versus anxiety disordersExperiencing situational anxiety does not always mean you have an anxiety disorder.It’s natural to feel some anxiety when you’re entering unfamiliar or uncomfortable territory. If you don’t enjoy public speaking, for example, feeling anxious every time you have to give a lecture is an expected reaction.With situational anxiety, psychological distress is short-lived and doesn’t affect your ability to function long term.When anxiety about a certain situation becomes persistent, pervasive, and can negatively affect the way you function, you may have anxiety disorders, such as generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, or a specific phobia.To determine a diagnosis, a mental health professional considers your symptoms, what is their duration, how frequently they’re present in your daily life, and how significantly they affect your function.A diagnosis of specific phobia, for example, is given if you meet the following criteria outlined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition, text revision (DSM-5-TR):notable fear of a specific object or situationthe object or situation always causes immediate fear or anxietyanxiety and fear are out of proportion to the actual threatfeelings of fear, anxiety, or avoidance persist for 6 months or longerfear, anxiety, or avoidance cause clinically significant impairment across important areas of functionsymptoms can’t be explained by substance use or other medical conditionsAccording to interview data from the National Comorbidity Survey Replication, an estimated 12.5% of adults in the United States will experience a specific phobia at some point in their lives.Signs and symptoms of situational anxietySituational anxiety is anxiety, just linked to a specific situation. Common scenarios where people experience situational anxiety include:taking a testspeaking in front of a large audiencemeeting new peoplevisiting the doctorflying on an airplaneperforming on stageconfronting peoplesupervising meetingsinterviewing for jobsWhen you encounter a situation that causes anxiety, both physical and psychological symptoms are possible.Anxiety is more than just swirling thoughts and emotions. It engages your stress response, commonly known as the “fight, flight, and freeze” response. Changes in your body from this cascade of physiological processes can also cause somatic (physical) discomfort.Although everyone experiences anxiety differently, common symptoms of anxiety in a trigger situation may include:rapid heartbeatshortness of breathsweatingmuscle aches or tensiontrembling or shakingnauseadiarrheadizziness or lightheadednessheadachesinsomniadry mouthdifficulty concentratingracing thoughtsexcessive worry or fearirritabilityavoidance behaviorsfeelings of dreadhyper-alertnessIf you have an anxiety disorder, symptoms can be intense and last beyond the event itself. Given a trigger situation, it is also possible to experience a panic attack. Symptoms like choking or difficulty breathing can accompany an episode of overwhelm, immobilizing fear and dread.Examples of situational anxietyIt’s not always easy to know if what you’re experiencing is situational anxiety. Anxiety symptoms can vary between people, and some signs, like headaches or rapid heartbeat, can be attributed to other causes.Situational anxiety examples may include:sweating or feeling nauseous before taking examsconstantly worrying about making it to your airplane every time you flyhaving a headache and being preoccupied with being unprepared for presentationsavoiding social events altogether because you worry about people judging yousleeping difficulty because of racing thoughts about managing meetingsHow to manage situational anxietyStrategies that promote relaxation and stress reduction can help manage non-impairing, short-duration situational anxiety (anxiety that doesn’t affect how you navigate your world). You can use some of these as in-the-moment techniques and others to add proactively to your daily or weekly routine to relieve anxiety.Options to consider include:progressive muscle relaxationbox breathing or other breathworkmindfulnessmeditationsensory engagement (focusing on smell, sight, taste, touch, or sound)visualizationmind-body arts, such as Tai Chisupport groups and online communitiesIt may be helpful to slowly expose yourself to situations that cause anxiety to build tolerance. It’s OK to do this gradually. Rather than volunteer to give a college class lecture, for example, reading your presentation to one or two family members might be a good place to start.When situational anxiety is impairingPsychotherapy, medications, and supportive lifestyle changes can help when situational anxiety is impairing or an anxiety disorder is causing problems in your daily life.Psychotherapy, or “talk” therapy, helps you identify and restructure unhelpful patterns of thinking that may cause anxiety. Cognitive behavioral therapy and acceptance and commitment therapy are common psychotherapy frameworks for anxiety disorders.During situational anxiety treatment, a therapist may recommend a form of exposure therapy that allows you to gradually confront situations of anxiety in a safe and manageable setting.In addition to therapy, medications like antidepressants, anti-anxiety drugs, and beta-blockers can help regulate mood and relieve physical symptoms.Keeping up with or starting beneficial lifestyle habits that promote wellness may also strengthen a management plan for situational anxiety. For example, focusing on a nutrient-dense diet, exercising regularly, and getting quality sleep can help.TakeawaySituational anxiety describes anxiety that occurs each time you encounter a specific situation, like when taking an exam or visiting a doctor. It’s a natural response to uncomfortable or unfamiliar circumstances.Though it can cause discomfort at the moment, situational anxiety is usually short-lived and doesn’t affect your ability to function. When anxiety about specific situations starts to affect your life negatively, is persistent, severe, or lingers for extended periods, it may be a sign of an anxiety disorder. Only a mental health professional can provide an accurate diagnosis.Engaging in anxiety management strategies and working with a mental health professional can help you overcome situational anxiety in any form.",

We included a variety of blankets, each with unique features, to help you find one that fits best with your individual needs. Read more about our vetting process.Pricing: While weighted blankets are typically more expensive than regular blankets, there are still options for most budgets. We included blankets at several different price points to offer options for everyone.Material: Weighted blankets are made with a variety of materials, from microfiber and fleece to knitted cotton. Some have cooling technologies worked into the fabric to keep you at a more comfortable temperature. Others are made to be warm and cozy. We included a variety of blankets made of different materials to provide options for all preferences and climates.Weight: A weighted blanket should weigh about 10% of your body weight. Because of this, different people will have varying needs. We included blankets with a range of weight options so you can find one that’s suitable for your needs.What is a weighted blanket?A weighted blanket is a heavy blanket — usually one that weighs between 4 to 30 pounds — that’s used as a therapeutic tool to invoke calm and reduce stress.Weighted blankets simulate deep pressure touch therapy (DPT), which provides the same physiological response people get when they’re hugged or held.The blanket itself can be made from various materials, from cotton to bamboo to flannel, and the fill (which provides the weight to the blanket) is usually micro-glass beads, although it can also be sand, grains, or steel beads.What are the benefits of a weighted blanket for anxiety?Weighted blankets can help reduce anxiety in both children and adults, and they’re typically safe to use. They help many people achieve a relaxed state, allowing them to sleep more deeply. GroundingWeighted blankets help ground your body during sleep by pushing it down. This process, known as “earthing” or “grounding,” may have a deeply calming effect. The blankets also simulate DPT, a type of therapy that uses firm, hands-on pressure to reduce chronic stress and high levels of anxiety.Older research from 2014 shows that grounding may help reduce nighttime levels of cortisol, a stress hormone. Cortisol is produced when your brain thinks you’re under attack, eliciting the fight-flight-freeze response.Stress can escalate cortisol levels. This can have a negative impact on the immune system, increase blood sugar levels, and adversely affect the digestive tract.Elevated cortisol levels, especially those that don’t drop back down to normal levels naturally, can cause multiple complications. These include:depressionanxietyinsomniaweight gainPressure touchBy providing deep pressure touch, weighted blankets can promote relaxation and help break this cycle. This may trigger the release of the neurotransmitters dopamine and serotonin, which are feel-good hormones produced in the brain. These hormones help combat stress, anxiety, and depression. A 2020 review of studies indicated that weighted blankets may be helpful in relieving anxiety. More research is needed to determine whether they can also help with insomnia.According to the review, grounding helped reduce cortisol production in the participants during sleep. This improved their sleep and alleviated stress, insomnia, and pain.A study from 2008 found that 30-pound weighted blankets are a safe and effective way to reduce anxiety in adults. Of the 32 adults who participated in the study, 63% reported lower levels of anxiety.Sleep improvementBecause weighted blankets can reduce stress and calm you down, they may also lead to improvements in sleep quality. In a 2020 study, researchers found that people who slept with weighted blankets reported reduced insomnia, better sleep, and more energy during the day. They also said they had fewer feelings of fatigue, depression, and anxiety. It’s worth noting that, in addition to insomnia, all participants in this sleep trial either had major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, GAD, or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).In a 2015 study, participants with mild to moderate insomnia who used a weighted blanket for 4 weeks experienced better sleep with less tossing and turning. The participants also reported that they were more comfortable.How heavy should a weighted blanket be?Your doctor or an occupational therapist can help you to decide which weighted blanket will be the most comfortable and efficient for you.Your own weight should help you determine the weight of the blanket. The general recommendation is to choose a blanket that’s 10% of your body weight, adding or subtracting 1 to 2 pounds depending on your preference.It’s also a good idea to choose a blanket that’s made from a natural fiber, such as breathable 100% cotton. Polyester and other synthetic fabrics are typically much hotter.Weighted blankets aren’t for everyone, since they may add some heat as well as weight. Before using a weighted blanket, you should discuss it with your doctor if you:have a chronic health conditionare going through menopausehave circulation issueshave respiration issueshave temperature regulation issuesFrequently asked questions about weighted blanketsCan I use a weighted blanket every night?Yes, you can use a weighted blanket every night.

However, if you’re nervous about using one, it may make your anxiety worse in the short term.To ease yourself into it, you can start with short durations, like a few minutes at a time, until you get used to how the weighted blanket feels.

    "articleTextBody": "The term gluten refers to a group of proteins found in a variety of cereal grains, including wheat, rye, and barley.While most people are able to tolerate gluten, it can trigger a number of adverse side effects in those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity.In addition to causing digestive distress, headaches, and skin problems, some report that gluten may contribute to psychological symptoms like anxiety (1).This article takes a closer look at the research to determine whether gluten can cause anxiety.Celiac diseaseFor those with celiac disease, eating gluten triggers inflammation in the intestines, causing symptoms like bloating, gas, diarrhea, and fatigue (2).Some studies show that celiac disease may also be associated with a higher risk of certain psychiatric disorders, including anxiety, depression, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia (3).Following a gluten-free diet can not only help alleviate symptoms for those with celiac disease but also reduce anxiety.In fact, one 2001 study found that following a gluten-free diet for 1 year decreased anxiety in 35 people with celiac disease (4).Another small study in 20 people with celiac disease reported that participants had higher levels of anxiety prior to starting a gluten-free diet than after adhering to it for 1 year (5).However, other studies have observed conflicting findings.For instance, one study found that women with celiac disease were more likely to have anxiety, compared with the general population, even after complying with a gluten-free diet (6).Notably, living with family was also associated with a higher risk of anxiety disorders in the study, which may be attributed to the stress caused by buying and preparing meals for family members with and without celiac disease (6).What’s more, a 2020 study in 283 people with celiac disease reported a high incidence of anxiety in those with celiac disease and found that adherence to a gluten-free diet did not significantly improve anxiety symptoms. Therefore, while following a gluten-free diet could decrease anxiety for some with celiac disease, it may make no difference in anxiety levels or even contribute to stress and anxiety in others. More research is needed to evaluate the effects of a gluten-free diet on anxiety for those with celiac disease.SummaryCeliac disease is associated with a higher risk of anxiety disorders. While research has found mixed results, some studies show that following a gluten-free diet can decrease anxiety in those with celiac disease.Gluten sensitivityThose with non-celiac gluten sensitivity may also experience adverse side effects when gluten is consumed, including symptoms like fatigue, headaches, and muscle pain (7).In some cases, those with non-celiac gluten sensitivity may also experience psychological symptoms, such as depression or anxiety (7).While more high quality studies are needed, some research suggests that eliminating gluten from the diet may be beneficial for these conditions.According to one study in 23 people, 13% of participants reported that following a gluten-free diet led to reductions in subjective feelings of anxiety (8).Another study in 22 people with non-celiac gluten sensitivity found that consuming gluten for 3 days led to increased feelings of depression, compared with a control group (9).Though the cause of these symptoms remains unclear, some research suggests that the effect could be due to alterations in the gut microbiome, a community of beneficial bacteria in your digestive tract that’s involved in several aspects of health (10, 11).Unlike celiac disease or wheat allergy, there’s no specific test used to diagnose gluten sensitivity.However, if you experience anxiety, depression, or any other negative symptoms after consuming gluten, consult a healthcare professional to determine whether a gluten-free diet may be right for you.summaryFollowing a gluten-free diet may decrease subjective feelings of anxiety and depression in those who are sensitive to gluten.The bottom lineAnxiety is often associated with celiac disease and gluten sensitivity.Though research has observed mixed results, several studies show that following a gluten-free diet may help reduce symptoms of anxiety in those with celiac disease or a sensitivity to gluten.If you find that gluten causes anxiety or other adverse symptoms for you, consider consulting a healthcare provider to determine whether a gluten-free diet may be beneficial.Read this article in Spanish.",

    "articleTextBody": "Certain foods like almonds, and herbs, such as chamomile, can benefit brain function and potentially relieve anxiety symptoms.Anxiety is one of the most prevalent mental health conditions, affecting approximately 7.3% of the global population (1).It’s an umbrella term used to describe various disorders — such as generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety, and phobias — and is generally characterized by constant feelings of tension, worry, and nervousness that can interfere with daily life (1).In many cases, medication is often required as a main course of treatment. However, there are several strategies you can also use to help reduce anxiety symptoms, from exercising to breathing techniques.Additionally, there are many foods you can eat that may help support brain function and lower the severity of your symptoms, mostly due to their brain-boosting properties.Here are 9 science-backed foods and beverages that may help ease anxiety.Davide Illini/Stocksy United1. SalmonSalmon may be beneficial for reducing anxiety.It contains nutrients that promote brain health, including vitamin D and the omega-3 fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) (2, 3, 4, 5).These nutrients may help regulate the neurotransmitters dopamine and serotonin, which can have calming and relaxing properties (6, 7).In particular, a diet rich in EPA and DHA is associated with lower rates of anxiety. It’s believed these fatty acids may reduce inflammation and prevent brain cell dysfunction which is common in people with anxiety (8, 9, 10).This may also support your brain’s ability to adapt to changes, allowing you to better handle stressors that trigger anxiety symptoms (8, 9, 10).Vitamin D has also been studied for the positive effects in reducing symptoms of anxiety and depression. One 2020 meta-analysis showed that vitamin D supplementation was associated with lower rates of negative mood disorders (11).In another study, males who ate Atlantic salmon 3 times per week for 5 months reported less anxiety than those who ate chicken, pork, or beef. Moreover, they had improved anxiety-related symptoms, such as heart rate and heart rate variability (12).For the most benefit, try adding salmon to your diet 2–3 times per week.2. ChamomileChamomile is an herb that may help reduce anxiety.It contains both antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, which may help lower inflammation associated with anxiety (13, 14, 15).Though the mechanisms aren’t clear, chamomile is believed to help regulate neurotransmitters related to mood such as serotonin, dopamine, and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) (16, 17). It may also help regulate the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis, a central part of the body’s stress response (16, 18).Some studies have examined the association between chamomile extract and anxiety relief.One 38-week randomized study in 179 people with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) experienced a significantly greater reduction in symptoms after consuming 1,500 milligrams of chamomile extract per day compared to those who did not (15).Another older 2012 study found similar results, noting that those who consumed chamomile extract for 8 weeks experienced reduced symptoms of depression and anxiety. Though, the study’s low sample size could not provide enough statistical power to demonstrate cause-and-effect (16).While these results are promising, most studies have been conducted on chamomile extract. More recent research is necessary to evaluate the anti-anxiety effects of chamomile tea, which is most commonly consumed.3. TurmericTurmeric is a spice that contains curcumin — a compound studied for its role in promoting brain health and preventing anxiety disorders (19, 20).Known for its high antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, curcumin may help to prevent damage to brain cells related to chronic inflammation and oxidative stress (20).Moreover, animal studies suggest curcumin may increase the conversion of alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) — an omega-3 found in plants — to DHA more effectively and increase DHA levels in the brain (21).One double-blind, randomized study in 80 people with diabetes found daily supplementation of nano-curcumin — a smaller, more bioavailable form of curcumin — for 8 weeks resulted in significantly lower anxiety scores compared to a placebo (22).In another small, randomized crossover study, consuming 1 gram of curcumin per day for 30 days was shown to significantly lower anxiety scores, compared to a placebo (23).Though promising, most studies observed the effects of curcumin supplementation rather than obtaining curcumin from turmeric. Therefore, more research in this area is needed.That said, incorporating turmeric into your diet is certainly worth a try. To increase curcumin absorption, try pairing it with black pepper (24).4. Dark chocolateIncorporating some dark chocolate into your diet may also help ease anxiety.Dark chocolate contains flavonols, such as epicatechin and catechin, which are plant compounds that act as antioxidants.Some research suggests that the flavonols found in dark chocolate may benefit brain function and have neuroprotective effects. In particular, flavonols may increase blood flow to the brain and enhance cell-signaling pathways (25).These effects may allow you to adjust better to stressful situations that can lead to anxiety and other mood disorders.Some researchers also suggest that dark chocolate’s role in brain health may simply be due to its taste, which can be comforting for those with mood disorders (26).One cross-sectional study of 13,626 participants found those who consumed dark chocolate had significantly lower symptoms of depression compared to those who seldom ate dark chocolate (27).Furthermore, one review of nine studies concluded that consuming cocoa-rich products could improve short-term mood and affect (28).While this is promising, more research investigating dark chocolate’s long-term effects on anxiety and mood is needed. Further, dark chocolate is best consumed in moderation, as it’s high in calories and easy to overeat. For best results, enjoy a 1- to 1.5-ounce serving at a time.5. YogurtThe probiotics, or healthy bacteria, found in some types of yogurt may improve several aspects of your well-being, including mental health (29, 30, 31).Though still an emerging field of research, probiotics may support the gut-brain axis — an intricate system between the gastrointestinal tract and the brain. In particular, research suggests healthy gut bacteria may be linked with better mental health (32, 33, 34).Further, probiotic foods like yogurt may promote mental health and brain function by reducing inflammation and increasing the production of mood-boosting neurotransmitters, such as serotonin (35, 36, 37).According to one study, consuming probiotic yogurt daily for 6 weeks was associated with improved anxiety, stress, and quality of life in postmenopausal females (38).Though a promising field of research, more human trials are needed to explore the direct relationship between yogurt consumption and anxiety.It’s also important to note that not all yogurt contains probiotics. For the benefits of probiotics, choose a yogurt with live active cultures listed as an ingredient.6. Green teaGreen tea contains L-theanine, an amino acid that’s been studied for the positive effects it may have on brain health and anxiety (39, 40, 41).In one double-blind, randomized study, participants who consumed a beverage containing L-theanine reported significantly lower subjective stress and decreased cortisol levels, a stress hormone linked with anxiety (42).These effects may be due to L-theanine’s potential to prevent nerves from becoming overexcited. Additionally, L-theanine may increase GABA, dopamine, and serotonin, neurotransmitters that have been shown to have anti-anxiety effects (43).Moreover, green tea contains epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), an antioxidant suggested to promote brain health. It may play a role in reducing certain symptoms by also increasing GABA in the brain (44).Interestingly, the combination of L-theanine, EGCG, and other compounds found within green tea appears to play a synergistic role in promoting calmness and alleviating anxiety and may be more effective together than as separate ingredients (45).That said, more research is needed.7. AlmondsAlmonds are a great source of several nutrients thought to promote brain function, including vitamin E and healthy fats (46, 47).In fact, some animal studies have found that almonds could reduce oxidative stress and inflammation, which could be involved in the development of anxiety (48, 49, 50).Almonds may also offer other mood-boosting properties.For instance, one study found that increased consumption of nuts, including almonds, was associated with decreased symptoms of depression (51).Another study in 3,172 adults showed that males who consumed the highest amount of nuts were 66% less likely to experience anxiety than those who consumed the lowest amount. However, this association was not observed for females (52).Therefore, more high quality studies are needed to understand how almonds may impact mood and anxiety. 8. BlueberriesBlueberries are high in vitamin C and other antioxidants, such as flavonoids, that have been studied for their ability to improve brain health and relieve anxiety (46, 53, 54, 55).One 4-week study found that daily supplementation with wild blueberries was linked to fewer self-reported symptoms of depression in 64 adolescents (56).Some animal studies also suggest that certain compounds found in blueberries may reduce oxidative stress and ease symptoms of depression and anxiety (57, 58).Plus, some studies have even found that increased intake of fruits, such as blueberries, may be tied to a lower risk of anxiety (59, 60).Still, additional studies are needed to evaluate the effects of blueberries on anxiety.9. EggsEggs are an excellent source of tryptophan, a neurotransmitter that may be beneficial for anxiety symptoms (61).According to one study, inadequate protein intake and tryptophan — both of which are plentiful in eggs — could be associated with higher anxiety levels (61).Eggs also contain vitamin D, with around 6% of the recommended Daily Value (DV) in one large egg (62).Some research has found that low vitamin D levels may be associated with increased symptoms of depression and anxiety (63).However, while several of the nutrients in eggs may be beneficial, further research is necessary to understand the effects of eggs on anxiety specifically.Other foods that may help with anxietyWhile some of the foods listed below have not been studied specifically for their anti-anxiety effects, they’re rich in nutrients thought to improve related symptoms.Turkey, bananas, and oats: These are good sources of the amino acid tryptophan, which is converted to serotonin in the body and may promote relaxation and anxiety relief (64, 65).Meat and dairy products: These provide high quality protein including essential amino acids that produce the neurotransmitters dopamine and serotonin, potentially improving mental health (46, 66).Chia seeds: Chia seeds are another good source of brain-boosting omega-3 fatty acids, which have been shown to help with anxiety (46, 67).Citrus fruits and bell peppers: These fruits are rich in vitamin C, which has antioxidant properties that may help reduce inflammation and prevent damage to cells that may promote anxiety (46, 68).Though these foods may support your mental well-being, they should not replace any medications or other therapies prescribed by a healthcare professional.The bottom lineAnxiety is a complicated mental health disorder that requires a multitude of approaches to manage it effectively.Along with medication and therapy, the foods you eat may help support your mental health, reduce anxiety symptoms, and promote better brain health. In particular, whole, minimally-processed foods high in antioxidants appear beneficial.However, there’s not enough research to support using food as a first-line treatment for anxiety and therefore should not replace any medications or therapies recommended by a healthcare professional.Nonetheless, adding these foods to your diet is a great way to support brain health and overall well-being.",

    "articleTextBody": "OverviewTest anxiety is a type of performance anxiety. It can affect everyone from kindergarteners to PhD candidates. If you have test anxiety, you may have anxiety and stress even if you are well-prepared for the exam you’re about to take. A number of different factors can cause test anxiety. These can include:generalized anxiety disordera fear of failurea history of poor test takingTest anxiety can lead to poor performance on tests. Here’s how to recognize the symptoms and find ways to manage the anxiety.  Symptoms of test anxietyYou can experience physical, emotional, and cognitive symptoms if you have test anxiety.Physical symptoms may include:excessive sweatingnausea, vomiting, or diarrheastomach painrapid heartbeatshortness of breath headaches feeling lightheaded or faint Emotional symptoms of test anxiety can include feelings of:self-doubtfearstresshopelessnessinadequacyangerYou may also feel nervous, restless, or fidgety. Anxiety can also cause difficulty concentrating. You may feel like your thoughts are jumbled and you’ve forgotten everything that you’ve learned. You can also become more indecisive, and you may struggle to choose between two different answers.In severe cases of test anxiety, these symptoms may be a precursor to or part of a panic attack. Test anxiety statisticsAnxiety disorders are common, affecting about 18 percent of adults. But only about a third of people with anxiety seek treatment, according to the Anxiety and Depression Association of America (ADAA). Anxiety disorders affect an estimated 25 percent of 13- to 18-year-olds. Untreated childhood anxiety can cause children to perform poorly in school and on tests. According to a 2010 study, text anxiety can affect anywhere between 10 to 40 percent of all students. That percentage has seemed to increase alongside the increase in standardized testing.One study found that test anxiety is more detrimental to performance for some people than others. Students with good working memories actually achieved higher test results when they had test anxiety. However, students with poor working memory had poor test results associated with test anxiety.Learn more about generalized anxiety disorder » Treatment and medication for test anxietySome students will experience severe test anxiety. In severe test anxiety, symptoms are more intense and persistent. These students may experience panic attacks. They may continue to have poor test performances despite thorough studying. Your doctor or your child’s pediatrician can prescribe medications to help control severe anxiety. Medication can also reduce panic attacks. Your doctor may refer you to a counselor to help with stress management. A counselor can help you learn methods for coping with anxiety. A counselor can also help you cope with any self-doubt or low self-esteem that could be causing the performance anxiety. If you or your child has severe test anxiety, you may get approval for them to receive special accommodations. Anxiety disorders are protected under the Americans with Disabilities Act. This includes test anxiety. Once you file the required paperwork, you or your child can take exams in a separate, quiet room, and you may be given additional time to complete the test.  Tips for dealing with test anxietyThere are some different techniques you can use to cope with test anxiety, both before the test and during it. To cope with test anxiety before a test, the best thing you can do is prepare as much as possible. Learn the best study methods that work for you, and spend plenty of time studying before each test. When possible, take practice tests beforehand.You should try to get plenty of sleep the night before. The morning of, eat a healthy breakfast that has some protein to keep you going.During the test itself, there are several methods you can use to reduce anxiety: TipsTake several slow, deep breaths, and consciously relax your muscles one at a time.Read each question slowly and more than once. Make sure you completely understand what the question is asking.Take the test one question at a time. Focus only on that question.",

Any event or scenario that makes you feel frustrated or nervous can trigger it.Anxiety is a feeling of fear, worry, or unease. While it can occur as a reaction to stress, it can also happen without any obvious trigger.Both stress and anxiety involve mostly identical symptoms, including:trouble sleepingdigestive issuesdifficulty concentratingmuscle tensionirritability or anger Most people experience some feelings of stress and anxiety at some point, and that isn’t necessarily a “bad” thing. After all, stress and anxiety can sometimes be a helpful motivator to accomplish daunting tasks or do things you’d rather not (but really should).But unmanaged stress and anxiety can start to interfere with your daily life and take a toll on your mental and physical health. Here’s a closer look at stress and anxiety, how they differ, and how to find support for managing both. What do stress and anxiety feel like?Stress and anxiety can produce a range of physical and psychological symptoms. Stress symptoms include:dizzinessmuscle tension digestive issues, including nausea and diarrheatrouble sleepinganger or irritabilityheadachesincreased sweatingfeelings of overwhelmrestlessnesschanges in appetiteincreased heart rateAnxiety can involve the same symptoms as stress, in addition to:a feeling of impending doomtingling or numbnessbrain fogLearn more about the signs and symptoms of too much stress.Differences between stress and anxietyThe big difference between stress and anxiety is the presence of a specific trigger. Stress is typically tied to a specific situation. Once that situation resolves, so does your stress.Maybe you have an upcoming exam that you’re worried about taking. Or you’re trying to juggle working from home with three small children who are competing for your attention. In both cases, there’s a specific root of your stress. Once the exam is over or your children return to daycare, your stress starts to go away. That doesn’t mean stress is always short-lived, though. Chronic stress refers to long lasting stress that occurs in response to ongoing pressure, like a demanding job or family conflict. Anxiety, by contrast, doesn’t always have a specific stressor. Can one turn into the other?While stress and anxiety are different things, they’re closely connected. In some cases, stress might trigger anxiety. If you’re stressed about a big upcoming move, for example, you might find that you start to feel generally nervous about nothing in particular.How to tell whether you’re experiencing stress or anxietyNot sure whether stress or anxiety is behind your symptoms?Take a step back and think of what’s going on in your life right now. What kinds of things do you tend to worry about? Are they specific threats or events?Consider car troubles. Maybe you know you really need new tires, especially now that it’s starting to snow. But you can’t afford to replace them just yet. For the next few weeks, you feel uneasy about driving. What if you slide on a patch of ice? What if you get a flat on your way home from a late-night shift on that stretch of road with lousy reception?A few weeks later, you have a fresh set of tires and stop worrying about driving to and from work safely. In this case, your nervousness was due to stress, triggered by having old tires. But maybe you get new tires and don’t really notice a change in your symptoms. You’re still nervous about driving and feel a vague sense of unease that you can’t quite put your finger on. Or, your tires were never an issue in the first place, but you can shake an overall feeling of nervousness about getting on the road. That would be anxiety. If you can tie your feelings back to a specific trigger, they’re likely the result of stress. But if the exact cause isn’t clear, or your symptoms stick around after the initial trigger goes away, it may be anxiety.What causes stress and anxiety?Stress typically happens in response to physical or mental pressure. This pressure might involve a big life change, like:movingstarting a new school or jobhaving an illness or injuryhaving a friend or family member who is ill or injuredexperiencing the death of a family member or friendgetting marriedhaving a babyBut stress triggers don’t need to be life-altering. You might feel stress due to:having a long to-do list to tackle over the weekendattending a big work meetinghaving a looming deadline for a projectStress and anxiety-related disordersStress and anxiety that occur frequently or seem out of proportion to the stressor could be signs of an underlying condition, including:Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). This is a common anxiety disorder characterized by uncontrollable worrying. Sometimes people worry about bad things happening to them or their loved ones, and at other times, they may not be able to identify any source of worry.Panic disorder. This condition causes panic attacks, which are moments of extreme fear accompanied by a pounding heart, shortness of breath, and a fear of impending doom.Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). This is a condition that causes flashbacks or anxiety as the result of a traumatic experience.Social anxiety disorder. This condition causes intense feelings of anxiety in situations that involve interacting with others.Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). This is a condition that causes repetitive thoughts and the compulsion to complete certain ritual actions.Techniques to manage stress and anxietyIt’s common to experience stress and anxiety from time to time, and there are strategies you can use to make them more manageable. Pay attention to how your body and mind respond to stressful and anxiety-producing situations. Next time this type of experience occurs, you’ll be able to anticipate your reaction, and it may be less disruptive.Certain lifestyle changes can help alleviate symptoms of stress and anxiety. These techniques can be used alongside medical treatments for anxiety. Techniques to reduce stress and anxiety include:limiting caffeine and alcohol consumptiongetting enough sleepgetting regular exercisemeditatingsetting aside free time for hobbies and activities that bring you joykeeping a diary of your feelings and things that trigger stresspracticing breathing exercisesopening up to loved ones about how you’re feelingLooking for more tips? Check out these 16 strategies for managing stress and anxiety.When to seek helpIt’s best to talk with a mental health professional any time stress or anxiety starts to affect your day-to-day life. Keep in mind: You don’t need to have a specific mental health condition to benefit from therapy. A qualified therapist can help you identify potential triggers and create effective coping mechanisms to minimize their impact, even if you don’t meet the diagnostic criteria for an anxiety disorder. It’s also worth reaching out if stress or anxiety leaves you feeling hopeless, or if you start having thoughts of harming yourself or others.If you’re not sure where to start, consider asking your primary healthcare professional for a referral.

A mental health professional can help you find the right approach for your specific symptoms. Some examples of approaches they might recommend are:Cognitive behavioral therapy, which teaches you to recognize anxious thoughts and behaviors and change them into more positive ones.Exposure therapy, which involves gradually exposing you to certain things that trigger anxiety. Acceptance and commitment therapy, which teaches you how to accept and sit with negative emotions. Depending on your symptoms, they may also recommend medication to help with anxiety symptoms. These may include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), such as sertraline (Zoloft) or paroxetine (Paxil). In some cases, a clinician might recommend benzodiazepines, such as diazepam (Valium) or lorazepam (Ativan), but these approaches are generally used on a short-term basis due to the risk of dependence.The bottom lineWhile some amount of stress and anxiety in life is expected and shouldn’t be a cause for concern, it’s important to recognize when these feelings are causing negative consequences. If you feel like your stress and anxiety are becoming unmanageable, a mental health professional can help you develop new coping skills.

    "articleTextBody": "Thyroid dysfunction may lead to mental health symptoms like anxiety and brain fog. An overactive thyroid is more likely to cause these symptoms, and management typically involves regulating thyroid hormone levels.The thyroid gland produces hormones involved in important body functions, from your metabolism to cognitive tasks and mood regulation. When your thyroid produces too much or not enough hormones, these body functions may be affected. This, in turn, could lead to many physical and mental symptoms, including anxiety. Thyroid conditions may also cause physical symptoms that could mimic those of anxiety disorders, like shakiness and increased heart rate.Can thyroid dysfunction cause anxiety symptoms?Yes, thyroid dysfunction can manifest with anxiety in some people, among other mental health symptoms. A 2020 study in people with autoimmune diseases found that altered thyroid hormone levels increased their likelihood of experiencing symptoms of anxiety and depression. Common thyroid dysfunctions include hyperthyroidism (an overactive thyroid) and hypothyroidism (an underactive thyroid). Common causes of both of these conditions include autoimmune disorders, like Graves’ disease and Hashimoto thyroiditis, respectively.Anxiety can occur in both hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism but may be more common in people with an overactive thyroid.Excessive production of thyroid hormones (T3 and T4) also causes physical symptoms that may be mistaken as anxiety, like rapid heart rate, heart palpitations, and irritability. In turn, experiencing these symptoms without warning could also trigger anxiety.A 2023 case study illustrated how hyperthyroidism can be misdiagnosed in some people as generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), hence the importance of checking your thyroid function when anxiety symptoms are present.Graves’ disease, the most common cause of hyperthyroidism, has also been associated with symptoms of depression and anxiety, and research suggests that it may be a bidirectional relationship. In other words, anxiety may be a result of Graves’ disease and also a possible trigger. Symptoms of thyroid-related anxietySymptoms of anxiety may vary from person to person. In general, anxiety may cause both physical and mental symptoms, some of which may overlap with hyperthyroidism symptoms, including:persistent nervousness or restlessnessincreased heart rate or palpitationstremors or shakingdifficulty sleeping (insomnia)irritability changes in moodunintentional weight loss persistent fatigue increased appetite or urges to eat difficulty concentratingThese symptoms may vary in intensity and overlap with other medical conditions, too. Only a healthcare professional can provide you with a diagnosis and recommend next steps.Other symptoms of thyroid dysfunctionBesides anxiety, other symptoms of hyperthyroidism may include: heat intoleranceincreased sweating even at lower temperaturesincreased bowel movementsmuscle weaknessdepressionHypothyroidism may also lead to other symptoms, including:unintended weight gain or difficulty losing weightcold intolerancedry skinhair thinningconstipationdecreased sweatingfatiguemuscle stiffness and achespuffy facedepressionHow to manage thyroid-related anxietyManaging thyroid-related anxiety primarily involves addressing the underlying thyroid condition.Professional help for hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidismA primary physician or endocrinologist can assess your thyroid function through blood tests and physical examinations.For hypothyroidism, treatment typically involves hormone replacement therapy with the synthetic thyroid hormone levothyroxine (Synthroid), which you may need to take for life. A healthcare professional will want to regularly monitor your thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels to ensure you’re getting the correct dose.Treatment options for hyperthyroidism may include: antithyroid medications such as methimazole (Tapazole)radioactive iodine therapythyroid surgery depending on the severity and cause of your condition Treating the underlying cause of anxiety, if related to your thyroid, may provide long lasting relief. If you continue experiencing symptoms of anxiety, consider talking with a mental health professional.Coping strategies for anxietyAlong with managing the cause of the anxiety, a few coping strategies can help with anxiety symptoms. These may include:Relaxation techniques: Deep breathing exercises, meditation, and yoga can help reduce anxiety symptoms. Healthy lifestyle: Regular physical activity can boost mood and reduce anxiety while a balanced diet rich in nutrients supports your overall health. Mindfulness practices: Incorporating mindful breathing and eating and grounding exercises can increase your awareness of the present moment and reduce anxiety.Support groups: Joining support groups provides community and shared experiences, which may help you manage your anxiety.Professional help for anxietyIf your anxiety symptoms interfere with your daily life, consider talking with a mental healthcare professional. They may recommend:Talk therapy: Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is the most effective form of psychotherapy for managing anxiety. CBT helps you identify and challenge negative thought patterns, teaching you coping skills to manage anxiety symptoms.Medication: In some cases, a healthcare professional may prescribe anti-anxiety medications to help you manage severe and persistent symptoms.Frequently asked questions\n{\n  \"@context\": \"https://schema.org\",\n  \"@type\": \"FAQPage\",\n  \"mainEntity\": [{\n    \"@type\": \"Question\",\n    \"name\": \"How do you tell if you have thyroid dysfunction?\",\n    \"acceptedAnswer\": {\n      \"@type\": \"Answer\",\n      \"text\": \"Only a healthcare professional can determine if you have thyroid dysfunction.

    "articleTextBody": "Participants showed benefits after a short, introductory meditation session.Stress and anxiety can make everyday life a challenge. They’re the mental monsters that harm the well-being of millions daily, leading to long-term effects on health. In the hopes of finding a way to combat stress, researchers are investigating if a single, hour-long meditation session can counteract the negative effects of anxiety and stress. In a small study that’s being presented today at the 2018 Experimental Biology meeting, researchers found evidence that a single session of mindful meditation can help reverse the physical and psychological toll of stress on the body. Over the past decade, meditation and mindfulness have become popular regimens in healthy living. They’ve evolved from being just a fad to a legitimate player in the fight against cardiovascular disease and other conditions exacerbated by stress. Previous research on meditation and anxiety have shown significant reductions in anxiety levels after weeks of meditation. But this study suggests that just one meditation session can lower anxiety and potentially a person’s cardiovascular risk. More research is needed to confirm these findings, however. John J. Durocher, PhD, assistant professor of physiology in the department of biological sciences at Michigan Technological University and Hannah Marti, a recent graduate of Michigan Technological University, led the research. They measured the 14 participants’ anxiety using a system called the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) before and after they underwent a 60-minute introductory mindful meditation session.The researchers found that meditation had significant effects on both physical and mental symptoms of anxiety. Participants reported far less anxiety on the BAI, but they also had physical indicators of less stress. After one hour of meditation, researchers found that there was a significant change on blood vessel wall stiffness — indicating less stress or pressure on their arteries — immediately after meditation. This reduction was also seen an hour after the meditation as well.As a result of these early findings, the researchers suggest people can start to see psychological and physical benefits from a single introductory session of mindful meditation — and possibly even lower their cardiovascular risk. While this study is small and yet to be published in a medical journal, the researchers say it can help open a new pathway of research. How meditation can help your heartSearching for new ways to combat stress and anxiety is a key goal for doctors, as a large portion of adults report feeling anxiety every year. According to the most recent data available, the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) estimates more than 19 percent of adults experienced anxiety within the past year and more than 31 percent experienced an anxiety disorder at some point in their lifetime. The NIMH notes anxiety disorders are higher in females than males. Everybody feels stress and anxiety in different ways. But when stress becomes excessive, it can contribute to high blood pressure, elevated cholesterol, physical inactivity, and overeating — all of which contribute to heart disease and stroke, according to the American Heart Association.However, mindful meditation has been shown to help not only stress and anxiety, but other conditions often exacerbated by chronic stress as well.It can reduce pain, boost the immune system, and ease inflammation in chronic conditions. It can even help increase gray matter in the brain, build focus and concentration, reduce loneliness, and even cultivate willpower. “There is an increasing body of research that is providing an evidence base for the utility of meditation and mindful meditation, and even combining it with traditional treatments like cognitive behavioral therapy as a treatment for anxiety,” said Dr. Ramani Durvasula, professor of psychology at California State University, Los Angeles. “Given that anxiety is in fact a ‘head game,’ it would follow that it could also be managed by techniques that focus on distraction, refocusing body sensations, and thinking differently.”A future treatment for chronic stress? Durvasula notes that although the sample size of this study is small, “this entire body of research as a whole has promise.”She believes that with additional well-designed and randomly controlled trials, larger sweeping claims can be made to the true effect of mindful meditation on cardiovascular disease management.Durocher and his team are planning to expand their research and now have funding from the Portage Health Foundation for another study, as well as a three-year grant from the National Institutes of Health for another mindfulness-based, stress-reduction study to help further understand the influence of blood pressure and anxiety to overall cardiovascular disease.“I am very happy with the outcome of this study,” said Durocher. “We feel that the results are very promising in regard to reducing anxiety.” The study participants appeared happy with the study outcomes as well. According to the researchers, many participants continued with their daily mindfulness practice after the first session and had decreased anxiety levels a week later.",

    "articleTextBody": "Stress or anxiety-related tension can lead to chronic pain in the neck and shoulders. Fortunately, this can be relieved with stretching or yoga, as well as relaxation and other stress management techniques.Let’s explore several simple techniques to help release tension in your neck and shoulders, as well as some stress management strategies to help calm your mind and body. How does stress and anxiety cause tension in your neck and shoulders?When you experience a stressful event or a bout of anxiety, your muscles contract, sometimes forcefully. This is an automatic or reflex reaction. It’s known as a stress response or “fight or flight” response. It’s your body’s way of gearing up to face a perceived physical threat that you’ll need to fight off or run away from. Along with muscle tension, you may also notice other physical symptoms when you’re stressed or anxious, such as:a fast heart ratequick, shallow breathingcold skinsweatingAlthough your body’s stress response is designed to help you deal with physical threats, your body responds in the same way when the threat isn’t physical. Your muscles may tighten up when you’re stuck in traffic, dealing with pressure at work, or watching the news. According to the American Psychological Association (APA), your muscles and other organs may only relax again once the perceived threat has passed. If stress is ongoing — meaning the stressful situation doesn’t seem to have a clear end — your body may stay in a heightened state of readiness to face a threat. As a result, your muscles may stay tense and tight for much longer than they need to. According to the APA, ongoing muscle tension in your neck and shoulders can lead to more serious issues like back and shoulder pain, body aches, and migraine and tension headaches. What can you do to ease stress-related neck and shoulder pain?Preventing stress-related neck and shoulder tension isn’t always easy to do, especially in today’s busy world. But, there are techniques and strategies that may help relieve muscle tension and ease pain and discomfort. Here are five stretches and poses you can do on a daily basis to help relieve tension and tightness in your neck and shoulders. 1. Neck stretch The neck stretch is a deep stretch that eases tension in your neck and helps improve your range of motion. Stand tall with your left arm at your side.Place your right hand on your head with your fingers pointing to the left side. Gently pull your head toward the right side until you feel a stretch in the left side of your neck.Hold for 20 to 30 seconds and return to center. Repeat on left side.Do 2 to 3 times on each side.2. Neck releaseThe neck release is a gentle way to loosen tension in both your shoulders and neck. Stand tall with both arms at your sides.Lower your head and bring your chin toward your chest. Gently tilt your head towards the right side and pause for 30 seconds. You should feel a stretch in the left side of your neck. Bring your head back to the center and lift to the starting position.Repeat before changing sides. Do 3 to 5 times on each side. 3. Child’s PoseChild’s Pose or Balasana is a well-known yoga pose that can help relieve neck and back pain. It’s also a gentle stretch that helps you relax. Get on your hands and knees with your palms flat on the floor, wrists under your shoulders, and knees under your hips.Sit back on your heels, lengthen your spine, and walk your hands in front of you. Make sure to hinge at your hips. Fold forward and keep your arms extended in front of you. Hold this position for 60 to 90 seconds. Focus on your breath while you release tension in your neck and shoulders. Return to the starting position and repeat. Do 2 to 3 times. 4. Cat-Cow PoseThe Cat-Cow or Chakravakasana is a yoga pose that allows you to stretch your back, torso, and neck, helping to release tension in these areas. Get on your hands and knees with your palms flat on the floor, wrists under your shoulders, and knees under your hips.Inhale and move into Cow Pose. Drop your belly towards the mat and lift your chin and chest. Look up at the ceiling. Open your chest and shoulders. Pause for a few seconds. Exhale and move into Cat Pose. Pull your belly toward your spine and round your back toward the ceiling. You should be looking down at the mat. Pause for a few seconds. Inhale and come back into Cow Pose and repeat the sequence.Do 10 to 12 times. 5. Thread the needle Thread the needle is a stretch that helps release tension in your back, neck, and shoulders. Get on your hands and knees with your palms flat on the floor, wrists under your shoulders, and knees under your hips.Slide your right hand (palm up) on the floor to the left side of your body. Your body will rotate with the movement, and your right shoulder will touch the floor as you look to the left side. Use your left hand to support your weight. Hold this position for 20 to 30 seconds and return to the starting position.Repeat on the left side. Do 2 to 3 times on each side. Other options for neck and shoulder tensionYoga is an excellent activity to help release stress-related tension in your neck and shoulders. In fact, one study found that 9 weeks of yoga resulted in pain relief and functional improvements in people with neck pain. There are also some other strategies you can use to help relieve or prevent tension in your neck. For instance you can: Apply a warm compress to the tight area. Spend a few minutes doing a self-massage.Soak in a warm tub, and add a few drops of aromatherapy oil for extra relaxation.Adjust your workstation, so your computer is at eye level to avoid neck strain.Check your posture while you’re at your work desk — keep your hips, shoulders, and ears in a straight line.Get up and move away from your workstation for a few minutes every hour.At night, use a pillow that offers good support for your neck, and is designed to keep your head and neck aligned. Tips for managing stress and anxietyWe all experience stress. It’s almost impossible not to feel anxious or stressed at some point or another. But, just as your body has an automatic response to stress, it also has a built-in system to calm you down.Known as the relaxation response, it helps you recover from the “fight or flight” response. It brings all your systems back to normal and returns your body to a calm, resting state. The relaxation response also helps protect your body from health issues related to the stress response.There are a variety of skills and strategies you can use to help the relaxation response kick in. Here are some of them:Stress management skillsExercise and physical activity. Moving your body, even for 20 minutes a day, may help lower your overall stress levels and reduce tension in your muscles. If you can, get outdoors and take a brisk walk in nature. Breathing exercises. Belly breathing, also known as diaphragmatic breathing, is one of the simplest ways to relax. Voluntarily controlling your breathing can signal your entire body to relax. With belly breathing, you breathe in deeply through your nose, allowing your belly to expand, and exhale through your mouth. Once you know how to breathe this way, you can use this skill often to help you relax. Yoga. According to the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health, mind and body practices like yoga can help relieve stress, reduce anxiety, and boost your overall well-being. If you’re new to yoga, you may want to begin with a 10-minute restorative yoga session. Meditation. Research has shown that practicing meditation may help reduce the inflammation response caused by stress, and also decrease anxiety. Start with 5 minutes of meditation at a time, and increase by a few minutes each week. Progressive muscle relaxation (PMR). According to a 2013 study, PMR can help reduce symptoms of chronic neck pain. To do PMR, simply tense each muscle group in your body one at a time, and hold for 5 seconds. On the exhale, relax the muscles for 10 to 20 seconds before moving to the next muscle group. Keep in mind that as with any new skill, regular practice is the key. These practices may not work for you right away and that’s OK. But, as you use them over time, you’ll likely find that they help return your body to a calmer, more restful state. The bottom lineTension and tightness in your neck and shoulders is a common symptom of stress and anxiety. It’s part of your body’s way of gearing up to survive a perceived physical threat. In other words, it’s part of the “fight or flight” stress response.Fortunately, muscle tension in your neck and shoulders responds well to several different techniques, including targeted stretching, yoga, and other relaxation methods. However, if the pain in your neck or shoulders is severe, or doesn’t improve with stretches or other self-care techniques, make sure to follow up with your doctor.",
